We can think of\nWhen we work in the command line, we are working in a specific location of the file system, called the “working directory”.\nHow do we know where we are? We can use a command for that.\n\npwd command\n\npwd stands for print working directory\nprints out working directory location to the screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe location within the file system is also called path, because it tells that path that can be taken from the top-most directory to the specified location.\n\n\nLet’s try it. Run the pwd command in your terminal.\n\nbash-3.2$ pwd\n/Users/csifuentes\nbash-3.2$\n\nIn the response above, the path of my working directory is /Users/csifuentes.\n\n\n\n\nStructure\nBelow is a schematic representing the file system for three users: Imhotep, Larry, and Nelle.\nWhat do you think the user paths will be?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The file system structure for several user directories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is structure for each users directory?

How can we do that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use the ls command.\nLet’s try it. Run the ls command in your terminal.\n\nbash-3.2$ ls\nApplications    Movies              RNASeq\nDesktop         Music               SoftwareCarpentryStuffs\nDocuments       Pictures            VirtualBox VMs\nDownloads       Public              miniconda3\nLibrary         RNASeqAnalysis.R    notes\nbash-3.2$\n\nThat didn’t work right Let’s modify the the behavior of the ls command using the -F flag to list formats.\n\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ ls -F\nApplications/           Downloads/              Movies/                 VirtualBox VMs/         miniconda/              setup.sh\nCytoscapeConfiguration/ Dropbox-Uploader/       Music/                  bin/                    miniconda3/             single-cell-curation/\nDesktop/                EnsDb.Xtropicalis.v101/ Pictures/               course/                 notebooks/\nDocuments/              Library/                Public/                 igv/                    notes/\n\n\n\n\nIn the output, we see trailing symbols\n\n/ means the preceding is a directory\n\n@ means the preceding is a link\n\nfiles will have nothing preceding\n\n\n\n\nCleaning up\nAs we work in the terminal commands and outputs are printed to the screen.

This can be very helpful when we want to run the same command (or edit the command slightly) but do not want to retype the entire command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand syntax\nShell commands follow a general syntax.\ncommand option argument\n\ncommand is the main command\noption modifies the behavior of the command\nargument the source and/or target of the command\n\nLet’s take a look at a few examples:\n\n\n\nCommand\nOption\nArgument\n\n\n\n\nls\n-F\n/\n\n\nmv\n-i\n/Users/path/file /other/directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nOptions use either - or -- to signal their usage.\nOptions are sometimes called flags.\nArguments are sometimes called parameters.\nDepending on the command, arguments can be either a target (as in the ls command) or both a source and target (as in the mv command)\n\n\n\n\nCase matters\nWhat happens if we run the same command, but change the case? Let’s try with an example. We’ll use the ls command and the size option, s, which lists the directories and files, but add their block sizes alongside.\nFirst, let’s run the command ls -s.\n\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ ls -s\ntotal 8\n0 Applications                  0 Dropbox-Uploader              0 Pictures                      0 igv                           8 setup.sh\n0 CytoscapeConfiguration        0 EnsDb.Xtropicalis.v101        0 Public                        0 miniconda                     0 single-cell-curation\n0 Desktop                       0 Library                       0 VirtualBox VMs                0 miniconda3\n0 Documents                     0 Movies                        0 bin                           0 notebooks\n0 Downloads                     0 Music                         0 course                        0 notes\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ \n\nNow let’s do the same, but with a capital s, ls -S.\n\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ ls -S\nDownloads               CytoscapeConfiguration  Dropbox-Uploader        igv                     Music                   miniconda\nLibrary                 course                  EnsDb.Xtropicalis.v101  Applications            Public                  notes\nDocuments               miniconda3              Movies                  notebooks               VirtualBox VMs\nsetup.sh                single-cell-curation    Pictures                Desktop                 bin\n\nWe get a very different output. In the output above, we have the files/directories sorted by size (largest) file first.\n\n\nGetting help\nCommand usage is not always intuitive. Additionally, we’re often not aware of all the options/flags that can be used with a particular command. If you need help with how to use a command, you can try the following (depending on the command).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod of getting help\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\n--help or -h option/flag\nDisplays help menu for the command/program\nls --help\n\n\nman command\nDisplays the manual for the command/program in-depth\nman ls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Using the --help flag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Using the man command\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Different ways to interact with a computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful ls flags\nThere are A LOT of ls options/flags. A few quite useful ones are shows below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n-l\nReturns the results in a long format, which provides information about\n\nthe item type (- for file, d for directory, l for link)\nitem permissions\nthenumber of links or files inside that item\nthe item owner\nthe item group\nthe time the item was created\nitem size\nitem name\n\n\n\n-h\nReturns the results with a human-readible size value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Using the -lh options/flags.\n\n\nAbove the results are now listed, one item per line, in alphabetical order, and the additional information provided when using the -l flag/option. Using the -h flag/option, the sizes are much easier to read (in bytes or kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes) as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMultiple options or flags can be used at the same time by simply putting them one after the other, as above.\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring other directories\n\n\nCut, Sort, Join, Grep"

    "text": "File System\nThe file system manages and organizes our files and directories.\n\nFiles contain information, such as text or images.\nDirectories (what we often refer to as folders) contain files and other directories.\n\nWe can view this as a sort of “family tree” (or more like a root system), where there are “parent” and “child” directories. In the example file system below there are 5 sets of parent-child relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A representative file system.\n\n\nTwo of the 5 sets of parent-child relationships are shown below. Can you think of the other sets?\n\n\n\n\nRelationship 1\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n  A[\"/\"] --> B[bin]\n  A --> C[data]\n  A --> D[Users]\n  A --> E[tmp]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship 2\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n  A[Users] --> B[nelle]\n  A --> C[larry]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Two of the five parent-child relationships in the file structure from Figure 1.\n\n\nThe file system also has a directionality, such that the directory that encompasses all other directories and files is at the top of the system and all other files or directories are below it. This top-most directory is called the root directory and is shown with the /.\n\n\n\nPaths\nAs you can see above, the directories, files, and subdirectories of a file system are connected. The route one would take from one directory or file to another is called a “path”. The path also describes the location of a file or directory within the file system. There are two types of paths:\n\nabsolute path – the path taken from the top-most directory (root, /), to the specified file or directory. The absolute path always starts with /.\nrelative path – the path taken from the present working direcotry to the specified file or directory. The relative path never starts with /.\n\nThe path to a few files is shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\nAbsolute Path\nRelative Path (from the /bin directory)\n\n\n\n\nplot.R\n/bin/plot.R\nplot.R\n\n\nconda\n/bin/conda\nconda\n\n\n\nWhat is the absolute and relative path to the mouse.gtf file if we are in the /data directory?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget\nAbsolute Path\nRelative Path (from the /data directory)\n\n\n\n\nmouse.gtf\n/data/mouse.gtf\nmouse.gtf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking Directory\nWhen we work in the command line, we are working in a specific location of the file system, called the “current working directory”.\nHow do we know where we are? We can use a command for that.\n\npwd command\n\npwd stands for print working directory\nprints out working directory location to the screen\n\nLet’s try it. Run the pwd command in your terminal.\n\nbash-3.2$ pwd\n/Users/csifuentes\nbash-3.2$\n\nIn the response above, the path of my working directory is /Users/csifuentes.\n\n\n\n\nListing files and directories\nWhen we’re using a terminal and in a specific directory, we often want to know which files and directories are in our current working directory. How can we do that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use the ls command.\nLet’s try it. Run the ls command in your terminal.\n\nbash-3.2$ ls\nApplications    Movies              RNASeq\nDesktop         Music               SoftwareCarpentryStuffs\nDocuments       Pictures            VirtualBox VMs\nDownloads       Public              miniconda3\nLibrary         RNASeqAnalysis.R    notes\nbash-3.2$\n\nThat didn’t work as we wanted it to.\nLet’s modify the the behavior of the ls command using the -F flag to list formats.\n\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ ls -F\nApplications/           Downloads/              Movies/                 VirtualBox VMs/         miniconda/              setup.sh\nCytoscapeConfiguration/ Dropbox-Uploader/       Music/                  bin/                    miniconda3/             single-cell-curation/\nDesktop/                EnsDb.Xtropicalis.v101/ Pictures/               course/                 notebooks/\nDocuments/              Library/                Public/                 igv/                    notes/\n\n\n\n\nIn the output, we see trailing symbols\n\n/ means the preceding is a directory\n\n@ means the preceding is a link\n\nfiles will have nothing preceding\n\n\n\n\nCleaning up\nAs we work in the terminal commands and outputs are printed to the screen.

But what if we needed to know some of the commands we ran previously? Don’t worry, the terminal keeps the command history.\n\nhistory command\n\nhistory stands for history\nprints the last x number of commands that were run\n\n\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ history\n   16  pwd\n   17  ls\n   18  ks\n   19  ls\n   20  ls -F\n   21  clear\n   22  history\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe can see the most recent command by tapping the “up arrow” on our keyboard. This can be very helpful when we want to run the same command (or edit the command slightly) but do not want to retype the entire command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring other directories\n\nList in other directories\nSo far we have only used ls to list items in our current working directory. Let’s see take a look at other directories. We can do this by passing a directory as the target of the ls command.\nUsing the test data, list the files in data-shell and data/shell/creatures.\n\n\nCreating new directories\n\n\nMoving to new directories"

    "text": "What is the shell?\nThe Shell is one of the ways we can interact with a computer. It is a program that allows users to tell the computer what to do, to give the computer a “command”, and is commonly used through a command line interface (CLI).\nAnother, perhaps more common way we tell the computer what to do is through the use of a graphical user interface (GUI). This usually involves a “point and click” approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Command Line Interface (CLI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Different ways to interact with a computer\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy use the shell?\nIsn’t pointing and clicking easier?\n\nThought experiment\nFor example, let’s say that we need to take the third line of a file and put it into a single new file. This is easy to do with a GUI and requires just 4 steps:\n\nOpen the original file.\nCopy from original file\nPaste to the new file.\nClose each file.\n\nWhat if we make it more complicated?\n\nDo this with 1000 files?\nEach file is in it’s own directory?\n\nTake a look below to see the process for GUI and CLI.\n\nGUI StepsCLI Code\n\n\n1. Open the original file.\n2. Copy from original file\n3. Paste to the new file.\n4. Close each file.\n5. Navigate to another file.\n6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 999 times until you are done.\n\n\nfor i in */*.txt;\ndo;\n    sed -n3 '3p' $i > new.txt;\ndone\n\n\n\nFor this task, the GUI was tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone while the CLI was a single-command, quick, and relatively error proof.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the shell\nLet’s start using the shell. Open the shell (terminal) on your computer.\n\nRunning our first command\nOnce we open our terminal, the $ shows us that shell is ready for input.\n\nls commmand\n\nls stands for list\nlists objects (files, directories, etc.) in a location\n\nIn terminal, type ls and press enter/return.\n\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ ls\nApplications            Downloads               Movies                  VirtualBox VMs          miniconda               setup.sh\nCytoscapeConfiguration  Dropbox-Uploader        Music                   bin                     miniconda3              single-cell-curation\nDesktop                 EnsDb.Xtropicalis.v101  Pictures                course                  notebooks\nDocuments               Library                 Public                  igv                     notes\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ \n\nEverything that is in your home directory is listed, alphabetically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nUpon successful completion of the ls command, the $ prompt is displayed, signalling that the shell is ready again.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first error\nThis is great, but what if we make a mistake? What happens then?\nThe shell provides (usually) helpful and informative error messages. Let’s test this by typing ks into the terminal instead of ls.\n\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ ks\nbash: ks: command not found\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ \n\nThe shell returned an error bash: ks: command not found. In this instance, it tells you that ks is not a command, or at the very least that it cannot find that command.\nWe’ll learn more about commands and command structure soon, but first let’s learn about the filesystem.\n\n\n\n\nCommand syntax\nShell commands follow a general syntax.\ncommand option argument\n\ncommand is the main command\noption modifies the behavior of the command\nargument the source and/or target of the command\n\nLet’s take a look at a few examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nOption\nArgument\n\n\n\n\nls\n-F\n/\n\n\nmv\n-i\n/Users/path/file /other/directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nOptions use either - or -- to signal their usage.\nOptions are sometimes called flags.\nArguments are sometimes called parameters.\nDepending on the command, arguments can be either a target (as in the ls command) or both a source and target (as in the mv command)\n\n\n\n\nCase matters\nWhat happens if we run the same command, but change the case? Let’s try with an example. We’ll use the ls command and the size option, s, which lists the directories and files, but add their block sizes alongside.\nFirst, let’s run the command ls -s.\n\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ ls -s\ntotal 8\n0 Applications                  0 Dropbox-Uploader              0 Pictures                      0 igv                           8 setup.sh\n0 CytoscapeConfiguration        0 EnsDb.Xtropicalis.v101        0 Public                        0 miniconda                     0 single-cell-curation\n0 Desktop                       0 Library                       0 VirtualBox VMs                0 miniconda3\n0 Documents                     0 Movies                        0 bin                           0 notebooks\n0 Downloads                     0 Music                         0 course                        0 notes\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ \n\nNow let’s do the same, but with a capital s, ls -S.\n\n(base) czimacos3304:~ csifuentes$ ls -S\nDownloads               CytoscapeConfiguration  Dropbox-Uploader        igv                     Music                   miniconda\nLibrary                 course                  EnsDb.Xtropicalis.v101  Applications            Public                  notes\nDocuments               miniconda3              Movies                  notebooks               VirtualBox VMs\nsetup.sh                single-cell-curation    Pictures                Desktop                 bin\n\nWe get a very different output. In the output above, we have the files/directories sorted by size (largest) file first.\n\n\nGetting help\nCommand usage is not always intuitive. Additionally, we’re often not aware of all the options/flags that can be used with a particular command. If you need help with how to use a command, you can try the following (depending on the command).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod of getting help\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\n--help or -h option/flag\nDisplays help menu for the command/program\nls --help\n\n\nman command\nDisplays the manual for the command/program in-depth\nman ls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Using the --help flag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Using the man command\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Different ways to interact with a computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUseful ls flags\nThere are A LOT of ls options/flags. A few quite useful ones are shows below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlag\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n-l\nReturns the results in a long format, which provides information about\n\nthe item type (- for file, d for directory, l for link)\nitem permissions\nthenumber of links or files inside that item\nthe item owner\nthe item group\nthe time the item was created\nitem size\nitem name\n\n\n\n-h\nReturns the results with a human-readible size value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Using the -lh options/flags.\n\n\nAbove the results are now listed, one item per line, in alphabetical order, and the additional information provided when using the -l flag/option. Using the -h flag/option, the sizes are much easier to read (in bytes or kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes) as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMultiple options or flags can be used at the same time by simply putting them one after the other, as above."
