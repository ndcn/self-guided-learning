    "text": "What is the shell?\nThe shell (also known as the command-line) is a program that allows us to tell the computer what to do by giving it a “command” Figure 1a.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOther names for the shell are terminal, Bash, UNIX command line, and more.\n\n\nAnother common way we tell the computer what to do is through the use of a “point and click” graphical user interface (GUI) approach Figure 1b.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Command Line Interface (CLI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Different ways to interact with a computer\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy use the shell?\nIsn’t pointing and clicking easier? Imagine you had the following task:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have a directory with 10 .txt files.\nPull the first line from each file into a single new file. You should end up with a list of all of the first lines.\n\n\n\nTake a look below to see the process for GUI and CLI.\n\nGUI StepsCLI Code\n\n\n1. Create new file\n2. Open file 1, copy line 1, paste into new file, close file 1.\n3. Open file 2, copy line 1, paste into new file, close file 2.\n4. Repeat 7 more times\n\n\nhead -n1 -q *.txt > new-file.txt\n\n\n\nFor this task, the GUI was tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone while the CLI was a single-command, quick, and relatively error proof.\n\n\n\nAccessing the Shell\nLet’s start using the shell. Open the shell (terminal) on your computer. Select the appropriate instructions below, based on your operating system.\n\nWindows InstructionsmacOS Instructions\n\n\n\nGo the the Start menu and select “All Apps”.\nScroll down the list of applications and select the Git option.\nFrom the drop-down menu, select Git Bash.\nA terminal should open up.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Finder and go to the Applications tab.\nScroll down the list of applications and select Utilities.\nSelect Terminal.\nA terminal should open up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the shell\nOnce we open our terminal, the $ shows us that shell is ready for input.\nLet’s see what day it is using the ls command.\n\nls stands for list\nlists the objects in a location\n\nIn your terminal, type ls and press enter.\n\nls\n\nexample.gtf\nexercise-data\nnorth-pacific-gyre\nthesis\n\n\nBefore we learn more commands, let’s learn about the structure of commands.\n\n\n\nCommand syntax\nCommands follow a general syntax\ncommand option/flag argument\n\ncommand – the main command\noption/flag – modifies the behavior of the command, often optional\nargument – the source and/or target of the command, sometimes optional\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nOptions use either - or -- to signal their usage.\nArguments can be either a target (as in the ls command) or both a source and target (as in the mv command)\n\n\n\n\nAlter Command Behavior\nLet’s change the way ls command behaves by providing a value for the option.\nIn your terminal, type ls -F and press enter.\n\nls -F\n\nexample.gtf\nexercise-data/\nnorth-pacific-gyre/\nthesis/\n\n\nThis -F option/flag returns the output in a different format, with a / following directories and @ preceeding symbolic links.\n\n\n\n\nGetting help\nTo better understand command usage and their options we can use the following (depending on the command).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod of getting help\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\n--help or -h option/flag\nDisplays help menu for the command/program\nls --help\n\n\nman command\nDisplays the manual for the command/program in-depth\nman ls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Using the --help flag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Using the man command\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Different ways to get help with a command.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking sense of errors\nThe shell provides (usually) helpful and informative error messages.\nFor example, if you look closely at the ls --help example above, you’ll see that the usage of --help actually resulted in an error (see below).\nQ&A: What is the error telling us?\n\nls: unrecognized option `--help'\nusage: ls [-@ABCFGHILOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxy1%,] [--color=when] [-D format] [file ...]\n\n\nQ&A: What is the error above telling us?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--help is an unrecognized option\n\nThe correct usage and options for ls"

What about exons?\nA reminder, the initial structure is below, with the chromosome name in the first field, and the feature type in the third field.\n\n# cd to ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data\ncd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data\n\n# view first few lines of the file\nhead example.gtf\n\n#!genome-build CNA3\n#!genome-version CNA3\n#!genome-date 2015-11\n#!genome-build-accession GCA_000149245.3\n#!genebuild-last-updated 2015-11\n1   ena gene    100 5645    .   -   .   gene_id \"CNAG_04548\"; gene_source \"ena\"; gene_biotype \"protein_coding\";\n1   ena transcript  100 5645    .   -   .   gene_id \"CNAG_04548\"; transcript_id \"AFR92135\"; gene_source \"ena\"; gene_biotype \"protein_coding\"; transcript_source \"ena\"; transcript_biotype \"protein_coding\";\n1   ena exon    5494    5645    .   -   .   gene_id \"CNAG_04548\"; transcript_id \"AFR92135\"; exon_number \"1\"; gene_source \"ena\"; gene_biotype \"protein_coding\"; transcript_source \"ena\"; transcript_biotype \"protein_coding\"; exon_id \"AFR92135-1\";\n1   ena CDS 5494    5645    .   -   0   gene_id \"CNAG_04548\"; transcript_id \"AFR92135\"; exon_number \"1\"; gene_source \"ena\"; gene_biotype \"protein_coding\"; transcript_source \"ena\"; transcript_biotype \"protein_coding\"; protein_id \"AFR92135\"; protein_version \"1\";\n1   ena start_codon 5643    5645    .   -   0   gene_id \"CNAG_04548\"; transcript_id \"AFR92135\"; exon_number \"1\"; gene_source \"ena\"; gene_biotype \"protein_coding\"; transcript_source \"ena\"; transcript_biotype \"protein_coding\";\n\n\nFrom last time, we remember that we need to remove the leading lines of the file to make it easier to work with, using grep -v '^#', then we can cut the fields that we need, sort and count the total genes with sort | uniq -c | grep 'gene'.

Note that we use the * at the end becuase all files have the same .pdb ending, so this is faster.\n\n# cd into the directory\ncd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/proteins\n\nls *ethane.*\n\nethane.pdb\nmethane.pdb\n\n\nListing files ending in ethane.pdb with a preceeding character, using ?.\n\n# cd into the directory\ncd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/proteins\n\nls ?ethane.*\n\nmethane.pdb\n\n\nAs shown above, wildcards can be used together and combined in different ways to form complex patterns.\nFor example, we can use ???ane.pdb together to indicate any 3 characters followed by ane.pdb.\n\n# cd into the directory\ncd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/proteins\n\n# list all files with 3 characters followed by ane.pdb\nls ???ane.pdb\n\ncubane.pdb\nethane.pdb\noctane.pdb\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiz Time\n\nQuestion 1:\nStarting from /Users/amanda/data, which command(s) whould take Amanda to her home directory (/Users/amanda)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\na.) cd .\n\n\n\n\n\nNO, will be in the same place\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb.) cd /\n\n\n\n\n\nNO, will be in root\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc.) cd /home/amanda\n\n\n\n\n\nNO, not where we want to be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd.) cd ../..\n\n\n\n\n\nNO, will be in /Users\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne.) cd ~\n\n\n\n\n\nYES, ~ is an alias for the user’s home directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf.) cd home\n\n\n\n\n\nNO, not a thing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ng.) cd\n\n\n\n\n\nYES, without input cd will take you to the home directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nh.) cd ..\n\n\n\n\n\nYES\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2:\nWith the file system shown, if pwd displays Users/thing, what will ls -F ../backup display?\nNote: -F adds a / to the end of directories.\n\n\n../backup: No such file or directory\n2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27\n2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/\noriginal/ pnas_final/ pnas_sub/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n../backup/ refers to /Users/backup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3:\nWith the file system below, if pwd displays /Users/backup and ls -r displays items in reverse order, what command(s) will result in the following output?\npnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/\n\n\nls pwd\nls -r -F\nls -r -F /Users/backup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYES.\nYES.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4:\nChris runs the following commands and realizes that sucrose.dat and maltose.dat should be in the raw/ directory.\n\n$ ls -F\n analyzed/ raw/\n$ ls -F analyzed\nfructose.dat glucose.dat maltose.dat sucrose.dat\n$ cd analyzed\n\nComplete the command below to move these files into the raw/ directory.\n\n$ mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat _____/____\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$ mv sucrose.dat maltose.dat ../raw\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5:\nChris gave you a file named file.txt, which contains a list of his favorite animals.
