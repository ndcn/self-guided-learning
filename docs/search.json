    "text": "Deciding on a place to start\nComputational reproducibility is not “solved”, because it’s a difficult problem. So where should we start? We can start by working toward “good enough practices” (see the publication below), which map to our barriers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Good enough practices in scientific computing. [1]\n\n\nLet’s revisit those barriers from before and see how these good enough practices map to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarrier\nGood Enough Practice\n\n\n\n\nOrganization\nData management Software Project organization\n\n\nDocumentation\nTracking changes\n\n\nAutomation\nData management Software\n\n\nDissemination\nCollaboration Manuscripts\n\n\n\nBelow, we dig into each of these a bit further.\n\n\n\nData Management\nIn data management, we want to ask ourselves\n  Who will be using these data?\n  What would others need to rerun this from scratch?\nIn answering these questions, the practices listed below become quite clear. The real trick is remembering to do it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice\nReason\n\n\n\n\nSave raw data\nEssential to rerun complete analysis\n\n\nSave intermediate data\nAllows for rerunnning portions of the analysis Allows for comparing discrepancies at each step\n\n\nBackup data\nPrevents data loss\n\n\nDocument all steps\nExact commands, parameters, input, and output are required for reproduction A shell script for each step, for example, would help achieve this Hand-written documentation may not fully reflect each step\n\n\nAutomate analysis\nManual data manipulation is more difficult to document faithfully\n\n\nUse meaningful names\nVariables, functions, and files should have meaningful, unique names\n\n\nOpen data practices\nProvides others with data to validate your work, earning trust Placing in a reputable DOI-issuing repository improves reach of your work Allows others to build upon your work, opening the door for collaboration\n\n\nUse “tidy” data\nSimplifies the analysis\n\n\n\n\nStep documentation\nTo have a chance at reproducing your work, one needs the entire command as executed. Imagine we wanted to do the_thing to each item in a specific directory location, ${DIR}. What would someone need to run this effectively?\n\nCommandNeeded Information\n\n\n\nfor ITEM in ${DIR}/*\ndo \n  the_thing -f ${PARAM1} -n ${PARAM2} ${ITEM}\ndone\n\n\n\nI need to know\n\nthe value of the inputs: ${DIR}\nthe value of the parameters for the options/flags: ${PARAM1} and {$PARAM2}\nany errors\n\n\n\n\nWe can do this in several ways (we can discuss later)\n\nRun each step in a script with information encoded\nPrint the command to the screen\nLog the command with something like tee\nOther ways\n\nAn example of doing this with a bash script is shown below:\n\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nDIR=\"/Users/csifuentes\"\nPARAM1=\"blah\"\nPARAM2=5\nLOG=\"/Users/csifuentes/good_log_file_name.txt\"\n\nfor ITEM in ${DIR}/*\ndo \n  COMMAND=$(the_thing -f ${PARAM1} -n ${PARAM2} ${ITEM})\n  echo ${COMMAND}\n  ${COMMAND} 2>&1 | tee -a ${LOG}\ndone\n\n\n\nAutomation\nAutomating code output (like above can help with documentation). Workflow managers, like Snakemake and Nextflow can allow one to log code and document at steps beyond this. We will talk about this in later sessions.\n\n\nUse meaningful names\nTo make is easier for others (and yourself), care should be taken to use meaninful names for any of the files, variables, or functions used in your work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNames should\nNot meaningful\nMore meaningful\n\n\n\n\nTell what they are/do, or reveal intention\nsample1.fastq.gz\nHs-sample1-treated-ATGATA.trim.fastq.gz\n\n\nBe different enough to tell apart easily\nmultiOmicWithInput, multiOmicFromInput\nmultiOmic_SampleA, multiOmic_SampleB\n\n\nEasy to read/pronounc\nsfns\nsuperFileNames\n\n\nBe unique and searchable\nd\ncell_type_holder\n\n\nNot be a “keyword” used anywhere else by computers/languages\nfor, in, list\ncell_type\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick introduction to tidy data\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Rules to form tidy data.

    "text": "Scripts\nScripts are files that hold a series of commands that are to be interpreted and executed.\n\nStarting a Script\nBecause scripts can be written in any language, the computer needs to know which interpreter to use to interpret the commands. The hashbang, #! (or shebang), followed by the location, tells the computer where to find the interpreter for the specific language that is being used.\nThese are usually found in specific locations, but can vary slightly. The options below are worth trying.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe hashbang/shebang must the be first line of the script – otherwise the # will be seen as a commenting line.\n\n\n\n\nUsing a Script\nUsing any script is similar to running the commands we’ve learned.\n\nbash script.sh\n./script.sh – need to have permissions to run it this way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhile we won’t cover this today, we can create scripts that specify flags and take inputs as parameters/arguments to be used as variable values in the script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting this into practice – Processig RNA-seq Data\nLet’s put this into action with an example RNA-seq workflow.\n\nRNA-sequencing\nRNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a method that allows for the sequencing of complex mixtures of RNA. Different analyses can be peformed with these data, including assessing\n\ngene expression (changes over time, or differences between groups/treatments)\ntranscript splicing\npost-transcriptional modifications\ngene fusions\nand more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor a good introduction to RNA-seq analysis, visit RNA-seqlopedia\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Analysis Steps\nWhile there are variations to RNA-seq analyses, generally, the following steps are performed\n\nDemultiplex reads\nInitial read quality check\nFilter and trim sequencing reads\nNormalize sequencing reads\nDe novo assembly of transcripts (if a reference genome is not available)\nMap (align) sequencing reads to reference genome or transcriptome\nAnnotate transcripts assembled or to which reads have been mapped\nCount mapped reads to estimate transcript abundance\nPerform statistical analysis to identify differential expression (or differential splicing) among samples or treatments\nPerform multivariate statistical analysis/visualization to assess transcriptome-wide differences among samples\n\n\n\n\nTools/Software\nThere are MANY tools that can be used at each of these steps, each with their own pros and cons. For this lesson, we will use the following, stopping after quantification:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nTool\n\n\n\n\nDemultiplex\nPerformed already (usually using bcl2fastq)\n\n\nInitial read QC\nFastQC\n\n\nFilter and trim reads\nTrimGalore!\n\n\nAlignment\nSTAR\n\n\nAbundance quantification\nSubread\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Datasets\nOur dataset here sequencing data files (fastq files) from 6 samples, that are divided into 2 groups (1 and 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Name\nGroup\n\n\n\n\nsample_01\n1\n\n\nsample_02\n1\n\n\nsample_03\n1\n\n\nsample_04\n2\n\n\nsample_05\n2\n\n\nsample_06\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe’ll implement this analysis using bash scripts.\nI will walk through the initial step here, then we will work more hands-on in each step, building the scripts together.\n\nInitial Read QC\nOne of the first steps will be to check the quality of the sequencing reads with FastQC.

    "text": "What is the shell?\nThe shell (also known as the command-line) is a program that allows us to tell the computer what to do by giving it a “command” Figure 1a.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOther names for the shell are terminal, Bash, UNIX command line, and more.\n\n\nAnother common way we tell the computer what to do is through the use of a “point and click” graphical user interface (GUI) approach Figure 1b.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Command Line Interface (CLI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Different ways to interact with a computer\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy use the shell?\nIsn’t pointing and clicking easier? Imagine you had the following task:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have a directory with 10 .txt files.\nPull the first line from each file into a single new file. You should end up with a list of all of the first lines.\n\n\n\nTake a look below to see the process for GUI and CLI.\n\nGUI StepsCLI Code\n\n\n1. Create new file\n2. Open file 1, copy line 1, paste into new file, close file 1.\n3. Open file 2, copy line 1, paste into new file, close file 2.\n4. Repeat 7 more times\n\n\nhead -n1 -q *.txt > new-file.txt\n\n\n\nFor this task, the GUI was tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone while the CLI was a single-command, quick, and relatively error proof.\n\n\n\nAccessing the Shell\nLet’s start using the shell. Open the shell (terminal) on your computer. Select the appropriate instructions below, based on your operating system.\n\nWindows InstructionsmacOS Instructions\n\n\n\nGo the the Start menu and select “All Apps”.\nScroll down the list of applications and select the Git option.\nFrom the drop-down menu, select Git Bash.\nA terminal should open up.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Finder and go to the Applications tab.\nScroll down the list of applications and select Utilities.\nSelect Terminal.\nA terminal should open up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the shell\nOnce we open our terminal, the $ shows us that shell is ready for input.\nLet’s see what day it is using the ls command.\n\nls stands for list\nlists the objects in a location\n\nIn your terminal, type ls and press enter.\n\nls\n\ncount.sh\nexample.gtf\nexercise-data\nfastqc.sh\nfastqc_step.sh\nfeature_counts.sh\nindex\nmetadata.txt\nnorth-pacific-gyre\nrnaseq\nrnaseq.sh\nsimulated_reads\nstar.sh\nthesis\ntrim.sh\ntrim_fq.sh\n\n\nBefore we learn more commands, let’s learn about the structure of commands.\n\n\n\nCommand syntax\nCommands follow a general syntax\ncommand option/flag argument\n\ncommand – the main command\noption/flag – modifies the behavior of the command, often optional\nargument – the source and/or target of the command, sometimes optional\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nOptions use either - or -- to signal their usage.\nArguments can be either a target (as in the ls command) or both a source and target (as in the mv command)\n\n\n\n\nAlter Command Behavior\nLet’s change the way ls command behaves by providing a value for the option.\nIn your terminal, type ls -F and press enter.\n\nls -F\n\ncount.sh\nexample.gtf\nexercise-data/\nfastqc.sh\nfastqc_step.sh\nfeature_counts.sh\nindex/\nmetadata.txt\nnorth-pacific-gyre/\nrnaseq/\nrnaseq.sh\nsimulated_reads/\nstar.sh\nthesis/\ntrim.sh\ntrim_fq.sh\n\n\nThis -F option/flag returns the output in a different format, with a / following directories and @ preceeding symbolic links.\n\n\n\n\nGetting help\nTo better understand command usage and their options we can use the following (depending on the command).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod of getting help\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\n--help or -h option/flag\nDisplays help menu for the command/program\nls --help\n\n\nman command\nDisplays the manual for the command/program in-depth\nman ls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Using the --help flag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Using the man command\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Different ways to get help with a command.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking sense of errors\nThe shell provides (usually) helpful and informative error messages.\nFor example, if you look closely at the ls --help example above, you’ll see that the usage of --help actually resulted in an error (see below).\n\nls: unrecognized option `--help'\nusage: ls [-@ABCFGHILOPRSTUWabcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxy1%,] [--color=when] [-D format] [file ...]\n\n\nQ&A: What is the error above telling us?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--help is an unrecognized option\n\nThe correct usage and options for ls"

    "text": "What is R? What is R Studio?\n\nR is a (mostly statistical) programming language and a software that interprets scripts written in R\nRStudio is an interface used to interact with R\n\n\n\n\nWhy learn R?\nIncreased reproducibility\nWhen using code, your analysis can be clearly understood and easily rerun.\nIncreased extensibility\nCombine R with 10,000+ packages to extend capabilities including image analysis, time-series, population genetics, additional languages, making websites, and more.\nWorks with a variety of data types, shapes, and sizes\nR has special data structures and data types to handle all sorts of data.\nR can also connect to spreadsheets, databases, and read in special data formats.\nCan produce publication-quality graphics Base functionality and packages allow you to create a variety of graphics, while controlling minute details.\nHas a large and welcoming community\nThe R user-community is VERY active, helpful, and welcoming.\nMany resources have been developed to help people learn how to use R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLooking for community and community resources?\n\nStack Overflow\nRStudio Community\nhttps://www.rfordatasci.com/\nhttps://rladies.org/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowing your around RStudio\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with R and can be use to do many things. We will cover things in bold and italics.\n\nwrite code and scripts\nrun code\nnavigate files on your computer\ninspect variables and data objects\nvisualize plots\nenable version control\ndevelop packages\nwrite Shiny apps\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: RStudio interface screenshot. Clockwise from top left: Source,Environment/History, Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer,Console. [1]\n\n\nRStudio is divided into 4 “panes”:\n\nThe Source for your scripts and documents (top-left, in the default layout)\nYour Environment/History (top-right) which shows all the objects in your working space (Environment) and your command history (History)\nYour Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (bottom-right)\nThe R Console (bottom-left)\n\n\n\n\nGetting Set Up\nWe want to keep our work (data, analyses, text) self-contained in a single directory, called the working directory. This allows us to use relative paths to other files in our scripts within that working directory so that we can move our project to other locations and share our project with others without breaking any scripts.\nWe can do this using “Projects” in RStudio.\n\nStart RStudio.\nUnder the File menu, click on New Project. Choose New Directory, then New Project.\nEnter a name for this new folder (or “directory”), and choose a convenient location for it. This will be your working directory for the rest of the day (e.g., ~/data-carpentry).\nClick on Create Project.\nDownload the code handout, place it in your working directory and rename it (e.g.,data-carpentry-script.R).\n(Optional) Set Preferences to ‘Never’ save workspace in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWorkspaces\nA workspace is your working environment in R and includes any user-defined object.\nBy default, all objects in a workspace are saved (to .RData) and reloaded when you open your project. While this can be useful, this can result in debugging issues by having objects in memory that you forgot about. Therefore, we recommended to turn this off by\n\nGo to Tools > Global Options.\nSelect ‘Never’ option for ‘Save workspace to .RData on exit.’\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Set ‘Save workspace to .RData on exit’ to’Never’. [1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Working Directory\nThe working directory is the place from there R (and your computer) will be looking for and saving files and directories.\nIt’s good practice to develop a common structure for your projects to:\n\nkeep things organized\nensure you and others can find things in various projects\nincrease the portability of scripts that might be useful in multiple projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirectory\nContains\n\n\n\n\nscripts/\nR scripts for analyses, plotting, etc.\n\n\ndata/\nRaw data and processed data (probably should be kept separately)\n\n\ndocuments/\nOutlines, drafts, other texts\n\n\n\nCreating our directory structure\nFor our purposes, we’ll create the following structure\n\n\n\nFigure 3: How it should look like at the beginning of this lesson [1]\n\n\nThat means a working directory called data-carpentry, then 3 subdirectories, data_raw, data, and fig.\nLet’s do this programmatically in the Console.\n\nUse R command called dir.create, passing the value “~/data_carpentry” as the “path”.\n\n\ndir.create(\"~/data-carpentry\")\n\n\nCreate the subdirectories.\n\n\ndir.create(\"~/data-carpentry/data_raw\")\ndir.create(\"~/data-carpentry/data\")\ndir.create(\"~/data-carpentry/fig\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe tilde ~ is a special character that means the home directory of the user.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteracting with R\nIn order to do anything in R we need to tell the computer what to do. We do this with a command. An example is the dir.create command that you used to create the directory structure just now. We can do this in 2 ways\n\nusing the console (as you did above)\nusing the script pane above\n\nWhat’s the benefit of using the script?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility. Commands types in the console will eventually disappear. Using a script allows you to keep a record of what was done.\n\n\n\nRStudio allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOS\nShortcut\n\n\n\n\nWindows\nCtrl + Enter\n\n\nmacOS\nCtrl + Enter OR Cmd + Return\n\n\n\nYou can find other keyboard shortcuts in this RStudio cheatsheet about the RStudioIDE.\n\n\n\nSeeking help\nIf you need help with a specific function, for instance mean(), you can type ?mean() and press enter. Documentation on the function will pop up in the Help window.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: RStudio help panel. When typing a word in the search field, it will show related suggestions. [1]\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic Code Completion\nWhen you write code in RStudio, you can use its automatic code completion to remind yourself of a function’s name or arguments.\n\nStart typing the function name and pay attention to the suggestions that pop up.\nUse the up and down arrow to select a suggested code completion and Tab to apply it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can also use code completion to complete function’s argument names, object, names and file names. It even works if you don’t get the spelling 100% correct.\n\n\n\n\n\nDealing with error messages\nWe WILL encounter errors, and a lot of them! Watch for red “X”’s next to the line number in RStudio to catch them.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: RStudio shows a red x next to a line of code that R doesn’t understand. [1]\n\n\nIf you need more help\n\nGoogle the error\nAsk a question (with appropriate context and an example) on Stack Overflow\n\n\n\n\nCreating objects in R\nYou can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:\n\n3 + 5\n\n[1] 8\n\n12 / 7\n\n[1] 1.714286\n\n\n\nThis can be more useful if we store these values as objects, which would allow us to refer back to these objects later.We do this by using the assignment operator <-.\nFor example, if we wanted to create an object named weight_kg and assign it the value of 55, we could type the following\n\nweight_kg <- 55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA note on naming\nObjects can be named just about anything (x, the_thing, other_5tUfF). Be thoughtful about what you use. Below are some guidelines\n\nBe explicit and not too long.\nThey cannot start with a number (2x is not valid, but x2 is).\nR is case sensitive, so for example, weight_kg is different from Weight_kg.\nThere are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., if, else, for, see here for a complete list). If in doubt, double-check\nAvoid dots (.) within names. Dots have a special meaning (methods) in R and other programming languages. To avoid confusion, don’t include dots in names.\nUse nouns for object names and verbs for function names.\nBe consistent in the styling of your code, such as where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc.\n\n\n\n\nWhen assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:\n\nweight_kg <- 55    # doesn't print anything\n(weight_kg <- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`\n\n[1] 55\n\nweight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object\n\n[1] 55\n\n\n\nNow that R has weight_kg in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. Let’s convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):\n\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 121\n\n\n\nWe can also change an object’s value by assigning it a new one:\n\nweight_kg <- 57.5\n2.2 * weight_kg\n\n[1] 126.5\n\n\n\nAssigning a value to one object does not change the values of other objects.\nFor example, let’s store the animal’s weight in pounds in a new object, weight_lb:\n\nweight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg\n\nNow, let’s change weight_kg to 100.\n\nweight_kg <- 100\n\nWhat do you think is the current content of the object weight_lb? 126.5 or 220?\n\n\n\nSaving your code\nUntil now, we’ve used the console. Since we want to save our work, let’s\n\nOpen up a script – by pressing Ctrl + Shift + N.\nSave the script – by pressing Ctrl + S and selecting the save location, and naming it.\n\n\n\n\nAdding Comments\nIn R the comment character is #. Anything to the right of # in a script will be ignored by R. We use comments to leave notes and explanations in scripts.\n\n\nChallenge\n\nQ&A: What are the values after each statement in the following?\n\nmass <- 47.5            # mass?\nage  <- 122             # age?\nmass <- mass * 2.0      # mass?\nage  <- age - 20        # age?\nmass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmass <- 47.5            # mass is 47.5\nage  <- 122             # age is 122\nmass <- mass * 2.0      # mass is 95\nage  <- age - 20        # age is 102\nmass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index is 0.9313725\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions and their arguments\nFunctions are “canned scripts” that automate more complicated sets of commands including operations assignments, etc.\n\nUsually takes one or more inputs called arguments\nOften return a value (but not always)\nExample: sqrt() takes a number as the argument and returns the square root of the number\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMany functions are predefined, or can be made available by importing R packages (more on that later).\n\n\n\nExecuting a function (‘running it’) is called calling the function. An example of a function call is:\n\nweight_kg <- sqrt(10)\n\nLet’s break it down\n\nthe value of 10 is given to the sqrt() function\nthe sqrt() function calculates the square root\nthe function returns the value which is then assigned to the object weight_kg\n\n\nReturn values\nAs noted earlier, a value is not always returned. If returned, the return ‘value’\n\ncan be any value, or thing\ncan be multiple values (a set of things)\ncan even be a dataset\n\nArguments\nArguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other objects.\n\nEach argument can differ based on the function, and must be looked up in the documentation (see below).\nSome functions take multiple arguments\nSome arguments MUST be specified by the user when calling the function\nSome arugments might take on a default value (these are called options) if left out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nOptions are typically used to alter the way the function operates, such as whether it ignores ‘bad values’, or what symbol to use in a plot. However, if you want something specific, you can specify a value of your choice which will be used instead of the default.\n\n\n\nLet’s try a function that can take multiple arguments: round().\n\nround(3.14159)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nWe called round() with just one argument, 3.14159, and it returned the value 3. That’s because the default is to round to the nearest whole number.\n\nLet’s modify the number of digits we want in the answer. How do we know how to find more information about the round function?\nWe can use args(round) to find what arguments it takes.\n\nargs(round)\n\nfunction (x, digits = 0) \nNULL\n\n\nWe can also look at the help for this function using ?round.\n\n?round\n\nWe see that if we want a different number of digits, we can type digits = 2 or however many we want. Let’s try it.\n\nround(3.14159, digits = 2)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\n\nIf you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you don’t have to name them:\n\nround(3.14159, 2)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\nAnd if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:\n\nround(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)\n\n[1] 3.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt’s good practice to put the non-optional arguments (like the number you’re rounding) first in your function call, and to then specify the names of all optional arguments. If you don’t, someone reading your code might have to look up the definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you’re doing.\n\n\n\n\n\nVectors and data types\nA vector is the most common and basic data type in R.\n\nCan be a series of values (numbers or characters).\nAssigned using c() function\n\nFor example, let’s create a vector of animal weights and assign it to an object weight_g:\n\nweight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)\nweight_g\n\n[1] 50 60 65 82\n\n\n\nA vector can also contain characters:\n\nanimals <- c(\"mouse\", \"rat\", \"dog\")\nanimals\n\n[1] \"mouse\" \"rat\"   \"dog\"  \n\n\nThe quotes around “mouse”, “rat”, etc. are essential here. Without the quotes R will assume objects have been created called mouse, rat and dog. As these objects don’t exist in R’s memory, there will be an error message.\n\nThere are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a vector. length() tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:\n\nlength(weight_g)\n\n[1] 4\n\nlength(animals)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\nAll of the elements are the same type of data. The function class() indicates what kind of object you are working with:\n\nclass(weight_g)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(animals)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\nThe function str() provides an overview of the structure of an object and its elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex objects:\n\nstr(weight_g)\n\n num [1:4] 50 60 65 82\n\nstr(animals)\n\n chr [1:3] \"mouse\" \"rat\" \"dog\"\n\n\n\nYou can use the c() function to add other elements to your vector:\n\nweight_g <- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector\nweight_g <- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector\nweight_g\n\n[1] 30 50 60 65 82 90\n\n\nLet’s break this down:\n\nIn the first line, we take the original vector weight_g, add the value 90 to the end of it, and save the result back into weight_g.\nThen we add the value 30 to the beginning, again saving the result back into weight_g.\n\nWe can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a dataset. As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are collecting or calculating.\n\nAn atomic vector is the simplest R data type and is a linear vector of a single type. These are the basic building blocks that all R objects are built from.\nThe there are 6 main atomic vector thar R uses:\n\n\"character\" for character (A) or string values (Apple)\n\"numeric\" (or \"double\") for all real numbers with our without decimal values\n\"logical\" for TRUE and FALSE (the boolean data type)\n\"integer\" for integer numbers (e.g., 2L, the L suffix indicates to R that it’s an integer)\n\"complex\" to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g.,1 + 4i) and that’s all we’re going to say about them\n\"raw\" for bitstreams that we won’t discuss further\n\nYou can check the type of your vector using the typeof() function and inputting your vector as the argument.\n\nVectors are one of the many data structures that R uses. Other important ones are lists (list), matrices (matrix), data frames (data.frame), factors (factor) and arrays (array).\n\n\nChallenge\n\nQ&A: What happens if we try to mix these types in a single vector?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\nR implicitly converts them to all be the same type\n\n\n\n\n\nQ&A: What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use class() to check the data type of your objects):\n\nnum_char <- c(1, 2, 3, \"a\")\nnum_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)\nchar_logical <- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", TRUE)\ntricky <- c(1, 2, 3, \"4\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnum_char <- c(1, 2, 3, \"a\")\nnum_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)\nchar_logical <- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", TRUE)\ntricky <- c(1, 2, 3, \"4\")\n\nclass(num_char)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nclass(num_logical)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nclass(char_logical)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nclass(tricky)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ&A: Why do you think it happens?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\nVectors can be of only one data type. R tries to convert (coerce) the content of this vector to find a “common denominator” that doesn’t lose any information.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ&A: How many values in combined_logical are \"TRUE\" (as a character) in the following example (reusing the 2 ..._logicals from above):\n\ncombined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly one. There is no memory of past data types, and the coercion happens the first time the vector is evaluated. Therefore, the TRUE in num_logical gets converted into a 1 before it gets converted into \"1\" in combined_logical.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ&A: You’ve probably noticed that objects of different types get converted into a single, shared type within a vector. In R, we call converting objects from one class into another class coercion. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy, whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other types. Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how these data types are coerced?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\nlogical → numeric → character ← logical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubsetting vectors\nIf we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one or several indices (positions of elements in the object, starting with 1) in square brackets.\nFor instance:\n\nanimals <- c(\"mouse\", \"rat\", \"dog\", \"cat\")\nanimals[2]\n\n[1] \"rat\"\n\nanimals[c(3, 2)]\n\n[1] \"dog\" \"rat\"\n\n\n\nWe can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the original one:\n\nmore_animals <- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]\nmore_animals\n\n[1] \"mouse\" \"rat\"   \"dog\"   \"rat\"   \"mouse\" \"cat\"  \n\n\n\nR indices start at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB, Julia, and R start counting at 1, because that’s what human beings typically do. Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0 because that’s simpler for computers to do.\n\nConditional subsetting\nAnother common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector.\n\nTRUE will select the element with the same index\nFALSE will not select the element with the same index\n\n\nweight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)\nweight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]\n\n[1] 21 54 55\n\n\n\nSome functions and logical tests will output vectors of logical values, which can be useful.\nFor exmaple, if you wanted to select only the values above 50:\n\nweight_g > 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n## so we can use this to select only the values above 50\nweight_g[weight_g > 50]\n\n[1] 54 55\n\n\nLet’s break it down. 1. The weight_g > 50 inside the brackets is evaluated and returns a list of TRUE for indices less than 50 2. The outside weight_g is subsetted based on that returned list, pulling out only the indices that are TRUE\n\nYou can combine multiple tests using & (both conditions are true, AND) or | (at least one of the conditions is true, OR):\n\nweight_g[weight_g > 30 & weight_g < 50]\n\n[1] 34 39\n\nweight_g[weight_g <= 30 | weight_g == 55]\n\n[1] 21 55\n\nweight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21]\n\nnumeric(0)\n\n\nA quick overview of some operators\n\n\n\nOperator\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n&\nand\n\n\n|\nor\n\n\n>\ngreater than\n\n\n<\nless than\n\n\n>=\ngreater than or equal to\n\n\n<=\nless than or equal to\n\n\n==\nis equal to\n\n\n\n\nThe function %in% allows you to test if any of the elements of a search vector are found:\n\nanimals <- c(\"mouse\", \"rat\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"cat\")\n\n# return both rat and cat\nanimals[animals == \"cat\" | animals == \"rat\"]\n\n[1] \"rat\" \"cat\" \"cat\"\n\n# return a logical vector that is TRUE for the elements within animals\n# that are found in the character vector and FALSE for those that are not\nanimals %in% c(\"rat\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"duck\", \"goat\", \"bird\", \"fish\")\n\n[1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n# use the logical vector created by %in% to return elements from animals\n# that are found in the character vector\nanimals[animals %in% c(\"rat\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"duck\", \"goat\", \"bird\", \"fish\")]\n\n[1] \"rat\" \"dog\" \"cat\" \"cat\"\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\nQ&A: Can you figure out why \"four\" > \"five\" returns TRUE?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using “>” or “<” on strings, R compares their alphabetical order. Here “four” comes after “five”, and therefore is “greater than” it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing data\nMissing data are represented in vectors as NA. When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return NA if the data you are working with include missing values.\nFor example, the mean() below:\n\nheights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)\nmean(heights)\n\n[1] NA\n\n\n\nThis feature makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data. You can add the argument na.rm = TRUE to calculate the result as if the missing values were removed (rm stands for ReMoved) first.\n\nheights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)\nmean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\nIf your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the functions is.na(), na.omit(), and complete.cases(). See below for examples.\n\n## Extract those elements which are not missing values.\nheights[!is.na(heights)]\n\n[1] 2 4 4 6\n\n## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed.\n#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `\"numeric\"` (or #`\"double\"`).\nna.omit(heights)\n\n[1] 2 4 4 6\nattr(,\"na.action\")\n[1] 4\nattr(,\"class\")\n[1] \"omit\"\n\n## Extract those elements which are complete cases.\n#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `\"numeric\"` (or #`\"double\"`).\nheights[complete.cases(heights)]\n\n[1] 2 4 4 6\n\n\nRecall that you can use the typeof() function to find the type of your atomic vector.\n\nChallenge\n\nQ&A: 1. Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector, heights_no_na, with the NAs removed.\nheights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)\n\nUse the function median() to calculate the median of the heights vector.\nUse R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)\n\n# 1.\nheights_no_na <- heights[!is.na(heights)]\n# or\nheights_no_na <- na.omit(heights)\n# or\nheights_no_na <- heights[complete.cases(heights)]\n\n# 2.\nmedian(heights, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 64\n\n# 3.\nheights_above_67 <- heights_no_na[heights_no_na > 67]\nlength(heights_above_67)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitations\n\nData Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists. https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html"

This can be done in a few ways: intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.\nWith intermediate steps, a temporary dataframe is created and used as input into the next function.\n\nsurveys2 <- filter(surveys, weight < 5) #filer surveys to create surveys2, the intermediate file\nsurveys_sml <- select(surveys2, species_id, sex, weight) #use surveys2 as input for the next step \n\nWhile sometimes useful (for initial validation, etc.), this can clutter the workspace and make it difficult to follow.\n\nNested functions fit one function inside of another.\n\nsurveys_sml <- select(filter(surveys, weight < 5), species_id, sex, weight) # filtering first, then selecting\n\nThis is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).\n\nPipes (%>%) are a recent addition to R and let you take the output of one function and send it directly to the next function as input. The package enabling this is magrittr, installed when you install dplyr.\n\nsurveys %>% # send surveys to filter\n  filter(weight < 5) %>% # use surveys as input, filter and send output to select\n  select(species_id, sex, weight) # use filtered data as input, select, and send output to console\n\n# A tibble: 17 × 3\n   species_id sex   weight\n   <chr>      <chr>  <dbl>\n 1 PF         F          4\n 2 PF         F          4\n 3 PF         M          4\n 4 RM         F          4\n 5 RM         M          4\n 6 PF         <NA>       4\n 7 PP         M          4\n 8 RM         M          4\n 9 RM         M          4\n10 RM         M          4\n11 PF         M          4\n12 PF         F          4\n13 RM         M          4\n14 RM         M          4\n15 RM         F          4\n16 RM         M          4\n17 RM         M          4\n\n\nLet’s break it down a bit.\n\nWe use the pipe to send the surveys dataset through filter()\nFilter takes that input, and performs the filtering to keep rows where weight is less than 5, then send the output to select\nSelect takes that input, and keeps only the species_id, sex, and weight columns.\n\nNote that since %>% takesthe object on its left and passes it as the first argument to the function on its right, we don’t need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument to the filter() and select() functions any more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word “then.” For instance, in the example above, we took the dataframe surveys, then we filtered for rows with weight < 5, then we selected columns species_id, sex, and weight. The dplyr functions by themselves are somewhat simple, but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe we can accomplish more complex manipulations of dataframes.\n\n\n\nIf we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we can assign it a new name using the assignment operator.\n\nsurveys_sml <- surveys %>%\n  filter(weight < 5) %>%\n  select(species_id, sex, weight)\n\nsurveys_sml\n\nNote that the final dataframe is the leftmost part of this expression.\n\n\nChallenge\n\nQ&A: Using pipes, subset the surveys data to include animals collected before 1995 and retain only the columns year, sex, and weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsurveys %>%\n    filter(year < 1995) %>%\n    select(year, sex, weight)\n\n# A tibble: 21,486 × 3\n    year sex   weight\n   <dbl> <chr>  <dbl>\n 1  1977 M         NA\n 2  1977 M         NA\n 3  1977 <NA>      NA\n 4  1977 <NA>      NA\n 5  1977 <NA>      NA\n 6  1977 <NA>      NA\n 7  1977 <NA>      NA\n 8  1978 <NA>      NA\n 9  1978 M        218\n10  1978 <NA>      NA\n# … with 21,476 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMutate\nFrequently you’ll want to create new columns based on the values in existing columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the ratio of values in two columns.

Because we have two continuous variables, let’s use geom_point() first:\n\nggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nThe + in the ggplot2 package is particularly useful because it allows you to modify existing ggplot objects. This means you can easily set up plot “templates” and conveniently explore different types of plots, so the above plot can also be generated with code like this:\n\n# Assign plot to a variable\nsurveys_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys_complete,\n                       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))\n\n# Draw the plot\nsurveys_plot +\n    geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\nAnything you put in the ggplot() function can be seen by any geom layers that you add (i.e., these are universal plot settings). This includes the x- and y-axis you set up in aes().\nYou can also specify aesthetics for a given geom independently of the aesthetics defined globally in the ggplot() function.\nThe + sign used to add layers must be placed at the end of each line containing a layer.

For data sets with large numbers of observations, such as the surveys_complete data set, overplotting of points can be a limitation of scatter plots. One strategy for handling such settings is to use hexagonal binning of observations. The plot space is tessellated into hexagons. Each hexagon is assigned a color based on the number of observations that fall within its boundaries. To use hexagonal binning with ggplot2, first install the R package hexbin from CRAN:\n\n#install.packages(\"hexbin\") #already installed, so commenting this out.\nlibrary(hexbin)\n\nThen use the geom_hex() function:\n\nsurveys_plot +\n geom_hex()\n\n\n\n\nExamine the above scatter plot and compare it with the hexagonal bin plot that you created.\nWhat are the relative strengths and weaknesses of a hexagonal bin plot compared to a scatter plot? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a discussion topic, so answers will vary.\nStrengths\n\nplot the density of points in each bin and can reveal patterns and trends that are not apparent in scatter plots\ncan be more readable with there are large amounts of overlapping data\n\nWeaknesses\n\ninformation is lost – don’t have the same granularity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding plots iteratively\nBuilding plots with ggplot2 is typically an interative process.\nLet’s define the data we’ll use, lay out the axes, and choose a geom.\n\nggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +\n    geom_point()    \n\n\n\n\n\nThen, we start modifying this plot to extract more information from it. For instance, we can add transparency (alpha) to avoid overplotting:\n\nggplot(data = surveys_complete, aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also add colors for all the points:\n\nggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\nOr to color each species in the plot differently, you could use a vector as an input to the argument color. ggplot2 will provide a different color corresponding to different values in the vector. Here is an example where we color with species_id:\n\nggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.1, aes(color = species_id))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\nQ&A: Use what you just learned to create a scatter plot of weight over species_id with the plot types showing in different colors. Is this a good way to show this type of data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = surveys_complete,\n       mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +\n   geom_point(aes(color = plot_type))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots\nWe can use boxplots to visualize the distribution of weight within each species:\n\nggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +\n    geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nBoxplots will, by default, plot the outliers as points.\n\nWhat if we wanted all of the data plotted, not just the outliers? We can do this by adding a layer of geom_jitter – but this would mean outliers are shown twice. To avoid this we must specify that no outliers should be added to the boxplot by specifying outlier.shape = NA.\n\nggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +\n    geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +\n    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = \"tomato\")\n\n\n\n\nIn the plot notice how the boxplot layer is behind the jitter layer?\nWhat do you need to change in the code to put the boxplot in front of the points such that it’s not hidden?\n\n\nChallenge\n\nQ&A: Replace the box plot with a violin plot; see geom_violin().\nBoxplots are useful summaries, but hide the shape of the distribution. For example, if there is a bimodal distribution, it would not be observed with a boxplot. An alternative to the boxplot is the violin plot (sometimes known as a beanplot), where the shape (of the density of points) is drawn.\nReplace the box plot with a violin plot; see geom_violin().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +\ngeom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = \"tomato\") +\ngeom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ&A: Represent weight on the log10 scale; see scale_y_log10().\nIn many types of data, it is important to consider the scale of the observations. For example, it may be worth changing the scale of the axis to better distribute the observations in the space of the plot. Changing the scale of the axes is done similarly to adding/modifying other components (i.e., by incrementally adding commands).\nRepresent weight on the log10 scale; see scale_y_log10().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = weight)) +\nscale_y_log10() +\ngeom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, color = \"tomato\") +\ngeom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ&A: Create boxplot for hindfoot_length. Overlay the boxplot layer on a jitter layer to show actual measurements.\nSo far, we’ve looked at the distribution of weight within species. Try making a new plot to explore the distribution of another variable within each species.\nCreate boxplot for hindfoot_length.

Consider changing the class of plot_id from integer to factor. Why does this change how R makes the graph?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we leave plot_id as an integer.\n\nggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length)) +\ngeom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, aes(color = plot_id)) +\ngeom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\nIf we change plot_id to a factor.\n\nggplot(data = surveys_complete, mapping = aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length)) +\ngeom_jitter(alpha = 0.3, aes(color = as.factor(plot_id))) +\ngeom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting time series data\nLet’s calculate number of counts per year for each genus. First we need to group the data and count records within each group:\n\nyearly_counts <- surveys_complete %>%\n  count(year, genus)\n\nhead(yearly_counts)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n   year genus               n\n  <dbl> <chr>           <int>\n1  1977 Chaetodipus         3\n2  1977 Dipodomys         222\n3  1977 Onychomys           1\n4  1977 Perognathus        22\n5  1977 Peromyscus          2\n6  1977 Reithrodontomys     2\n\n\n\nNow we’ll visualize the timelapse data can be visualized as a line plot with years on the x-axis and counts on the y-axis:\n\nggplot(data = yearly_counts, aes(x = year, y = n)) +\n     geom_line()\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this does not work because we plotted data for all the genera together.\nWe need to tell ggplot to draw a line for each genus by modifying the aesthetic function to include group = genus:\n\nggplot(data = yearly_counts, aes(x = year, y = n, group = genus)) +\n    geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be able to distinguish genera in the plot if we add colors (using color also automatically groups the data):\n\nggplot(data = yearly_counts, aes(x = year, y = n, color = genus)) +\n    geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating the pipe operator with ggplot2\nIn the previous lesson, we saw how to use the pipe operator %>% to use different functions in a sequence and create a coherent workflow.\nWe can also use the pipe operator to pass the data argument to the ggplot() function.\n\nyearly_counts %>%\n    ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = genus)) +\n    geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pipe operator can also be used to link data manipulation with consequent data visualization.\n\nyearly_counts_graph <- surveys_complete %>%\n    count(year, genus) %>%\n    ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = genus)) +\n    geom_line()\n\nyearly_counts_graph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaceting\nggplot has a special technique called faceting that allows the user to split one plot into multiple plots based on a factor included in the dataset.\nLet’s use it to make a time series plot for each genus:\n\nggplot(data = yearly_counts, aes(x = year, y = n)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    facet_wrap(facets = vars(genus))\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we would like to split the line in each plot by the sex of each individual measured. To do that we need to make counts in the data frame grouped by year, genus, and sex:\n\n yearly_sex_counts <- surveys_complete %>%\n                      count(year, genus, sex)\n\nWe can now make the faceted plot by splitting further by sex using color (within a single plot):\n\nggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(facets =  vars(genus))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also facet both by sex and genus:\n\nggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts,\n       mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(sex), cols =  vars(genus))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also organise the panels only by rows (or only by columns):\n\n# One column, facet by rows\nggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts,\n       mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(genus))\n\n\n\n\n\n# One row, facet by column\nggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts,\n       mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(genus))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nggplot2 before version 3.0.0 used formulas to specify how plots are faceted. If you encounter facet_grid/wrap(...) code containing ~, please read https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/news/#tidy-evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 themes\nUsually plots with white background look more readable when printed.\nEvery single component of a ggplot graph can be customized using the generic theme() function, as we will see below. However, there are pre-loaded themes available that change the overall appearance of the graph without much effort.\nFor example, we can change our previous graph to have a simpler white background using the theme_bw() function:\n\n ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts,\n        mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +\n     geom_line() +\n     facet_wrap(vars(genus)) +\n     theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn addition to theme_bw(), which changes the plot background to white, ggplot2 comes with several other themes which can be useful to quickly change the look of your visualization. The complete list of themes is available at https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html. theme_minimal() and theme_light() are popular, and theme_void() can be useful as a starting point to create a new hand-crafted theme.\nThe ggthemes package provides a wide variety of additional options.\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\nQ&A: Create a plot that depicts how the average weight of each species changes through the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we need a long format, with columns for year, species, and the average weight.\n\nGroup by year and species_id.\nCalculate the average weight with mean() on the weight column, save as a new column.\nUse summarize to proved the resulting table format.\nPlot the data, with year on the x-axis, and avg_weight on the y-axis.\nAdd a line for each value, with geom_line().\nFacet the plot based on species_id.\nSet the theme to theme_bw.\n\n\nyearly_weight <- surveys_complete %>%\n                group_by(year, species_id) %>%\n                summarize(avg_weight = mean(weight))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\nggplot(data = yearly_weight, mapping = aes(x=year, y=avg_weight)) +\n   geom_line() +\n   facet_wrap(vars(species_id)) +\n   theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomization\nTake a look at the ggplot2 cheat sheet, and think of ways you could improve the plot.\nNow, let’s change names of axes to something more informative than “year” and “n” and add a title to the figure:\n\nggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    facet_wrap(vars(genus)) +\n    labs(title = \"Observed genera through time\", #labs for labels \n         x = \"Year of observation\",\n         y = \"Number of individuals\") +\n    theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nThe axes have more informative names, but their readability can be improved by increasing the font size. This can be done with the generic theme() function:\n\nggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    facet_wrap(vars(genus)) +\n    labs(title = \"Observed genera through time\",\n        x = \"Year of observation\",\n        y = \"Number of individuals\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme(text=element_text(size = 16))\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also possible to change the fonts of your plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are on Windows, you may have to install the extrafont package, and follow the instructions included in the README for this package.\n\n\nLet’s change the orientation of the labels and adjust them vertically and horizontally so they don’t overlap.\nYou can use a 90 degree angle, or experiment to find the appropriate angle for diagonally oriented labels. We can also modify the facet label text (strip.text) to italicize the genus names:\n\nggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts, mapping = aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    facet_wrap(vars(genus)) +\n    labs(title = \"Observed genera through time\",\n        x = \"Year of observation\",\n        y = \"Number of individuals\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour = \"grey20\", size = 12, angle = 90, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5),\n                        axis.text.y = element_text(colour = \"grey20\", size = 12),\n                        strip.text = element_text(face = \"italic\"),\n                        text = element_text(size = 16))\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like the changes you created better than the default theme, you can save them as an object to be able to easily apply them to other plots you may create:\n\ngrey_theme <- theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour=\"grey20\", size = 12,\n                                               angle = 90, hjust = 0.5,\n                                               vjust = 0.5),\n                    axis.text.y = element_text(colour = \"grey20\", size = 12),\n                    text=element_text(size = 16))\n\nggplot(surveys_complete, aes(x = species_id, y = hindfoot_length)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    grey_theme\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\nQ&A: With all of this information in hand, please take another five minutes to either improve one of the plots generated in this exercise or create a beautiful graph of your own. Use the RStudio ggplot2 cheat sheet for inspiration.\nHere are some ideas:\n\nSee if you can change the thickness of the lines.\nCan you find a way to change the name of the legend?

There are many useful examples on the patchwork website\n\n\n\nExporting plots\nAfter creating your plot, you can save it to a file in your favorite format. The Export tab in the Plot pane in RStudio will save your plots at low resolution, which will not be accepted by many journals and will not scale well for posters.\nThe ggplot2 extensions website provides a list of packages that extend the capabilities of ggplot2, including additional themes.\nInstead, use the ggsave() function, which allows you to easily change the dimension and resolution of your plot by adjusting the appropriate arguments (width, height and dpi):\n\nmy_plot <- ggplot(data = yearly_sex_counts,\n                  aes(x = year, y = n, color = sex)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    facet_wrap(vars(genus)) +\n    labs(title = \"Observed genera through time\",\n        x = \"Year of observation\",\n        y = \"Number of individuals\") +\n    theme_bw() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour = \"grey20\", size = 12, angle = 90,\n                                     hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5),\n          axis.text.y = element_text(colour = \"grey20\", size = 12),\n          text = element_text(size = 16))\n\nggsave(\"name_of_file.png\", my_plot, width = 15, height = 10)\n\n## This also works for plots combined with patchwork\nplot_combined <- plot_weight / plot_count + plot_layout(heights = c(3, 2))\nggsave(\"plot_combined.png\", plot_combined, width = 10, dpi = 300)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe parameters width and height also determine the font size in the saved plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitations\n\nData Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists. https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html\nWickham, H.

Packages provide acccess to additional functions beyond those that come with R.\nHere we use functions from the package tidyverse.\nFirst, let’s install tidyverse (if you haven’t already).\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n\n\nLet’s load the tidyverse package.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   0.3.5 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.4.1 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\n\nNow we can read the data from the file into a dataframe object, surveys.\n\nsurveys <- read_csv(\"~/data-carpentry/data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv\")\n\nRows: 34786 Columns: 13\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (6): species_id, sex, genus, species, taxa, plot_type\ndbl (7): record_id, month, day, year, plot_id, hindfoot_length, weight\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nNotice the data types are set for each column of surveys, even though we didn’t set them. This is because read_csv will look at the first 1000 rows of each column and guess the data type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nread_csv() assumes that fields are delineated by commas. However, this may not always be the case. There are several other functions to read in data in a tabular format. The most generalizable function would be read_delim() which allows for the specification of column / field delimiters.\n\n\n\nLet’s view the contents of the first 6 rows of survey by using the head() function.\n\nhead(surveys)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 13\n  record_id month   day  year plot_id speci…¹ sex   hindf…² weight genus species\n      <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <dbl>  <dbl> <chr> <chr>  \n1         1     7    16  1977       2 NL      M          32     NA Neot… albigu…\n2        72     8    19  1977       2 NL      M          31     NA Neot… albigu…\n3       224     9    13  1977       2 NL      <NA>       NA     NA Neot… albigu…\n4       266    10    16  1977       2 NL      <NA>       NA     NA Neot… albigu…\n5       349    11    12  1977       2 NL      <NA>       NA     NA Neot… albigu…\n6       363    11    12  1977       2 NL      <NA>       NA     NA Neot… albigu…\n# … with 2 more variables: taxa <chr>, plot_type <chr>, and abbreviated\n#   variable names ¹​species_id, ²​hindfoot_length\n\n\nWe can change the number of rows we view by passing the option n to the function.\n\nhead(surveys, n=7)\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 13\n  record_id month   day  year plot_id speci…¹ sex   hindf…² weight genus species\n      <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <dbl>  <dbl> <chr> <chr>  \n1         1     7    16  1977       2 NL      M          32     NA Neot… albigu…\n2        72     8    19  1977       2 NL      M          31     NA Neot… albigu…\n3       224     9    13  1977       2 NL      <NA>       NA     NA Neot… albigu…\n4       266    10    16  1977       2 NL      <NA>       NA     NA Neot… albigu…\n5       349    11    12  1977       2 NL      <NA>       NA     NA Neot… albigu…\n6       363    11    12  1977       2 NL      <NA>       NA     NA Neot… albigu…\n7       435    12    10  1977       2 NL      <NA>       NA     NA Neot… albigu…\n# … with 2 more variables: taxa <chr>, plot_type <chr>, and abbreviated\n#   variable names ¹​species_id, ²​hindfoot_length\n\n\n\nNow let’s look at the last 7 lines using tail(), which works in a similar fashion.\n\ntail(surveys, n=7)\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 13\n  record_id month   day  year plot_id speci…¹ sex   hindf…² weight genus species\n      <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <dbl>  <dbl> <chr> <chr>  \n1     26557     7    29  1997       7 PL      F          20     22 Pero… leucop…\n2     26787     9    27  1997       7 PL      F          21     16 Pero… leucop…\n3     26966    10    25  1997       7 PL      M          20     16 Pero… leucop…\n4     27185    11    22  1997       7 PL      F          21     22 Pero… leucop…\n5     27792     5     2  1998       7 PL      F          20      8 Pero… leucop…\n6     28806    11    21  1998       7 PX      <NA>       NA     NA Chae… sp.    \n7     30986     7     1  2000       7 PX      <NA>       NA     NA Chae… sp.    \n# … with 2 more variables: taxa <chr>, plot_type <chr>, and abbreviated\n#   variable names ¹​species_id, ²​hindfoot_length\n\n\n\nFor a more complete view of surveys we can use the view() command.\n\nview(surveys)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are two functions for viewing which are case-sensitive. Using view() with a lowercase ‘v’ is part of tidyverse, whereas using View() with an uppercase ‘V’ is loaded through base R in the utils package.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are dataframes?\nDataframes are a VERY common data structure for tabular data.\n\ncolumns are vectors of the same length\neach column must contain a single data type (characters, integers, etc.)\n\nAn example of this is shown in the figure below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A dataframe comprising a numeric, a character, and a logical vector. [1]\n\n\n\nWe can also see this when inspecting the structure of the dataframe using the function str().\n\nstr(surveys)\n\nspc_tbl_ [34,786 × 13] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ record_id      : num [1:34786] 1 72 224 266 349 363 435 506 588 661 ...\n $ month          : num [1:34786] 7 8 9 10 11 11 12 1 2 3 ...\n $ day            : num [1:34786] 16 19 13 16 12 12 10 8 18 11 ...\n $ year           : num [1:34786] 1977 1977 1977 1977 1977 ...\n $ plot_id        : num [1:34786] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ species_id     : chr [1:34786] \"NL\" \"NL\" \"NL\" \"NL\" ...\n $ sex            : chr [1:34786] \"M\" \"M\" NA NA ...\n $ hindfoot_length: num [1:34786] 32 31 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ weight         : num [1:34786] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 218 NA ...\n $ genus          : chr [1:34786] \"Neotoma\" \"Neotoma\" \"Neotoma\" \"Neotoma\" ...\n $ species        : chr [1:34786] \"albigula\" \"albigula\" \"albigula\" \"albigula\" ...\n $ taxa           : chr [1:34786] \"Rodent\" \"Rodent\" \"Rodent\" \"Rodent\" ...\n $ plot_type      : chr [1:34786] \"Control\" \"Control\" \"Control\" \"Control\" ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   record_id = col_double(),\n  ..   month = col_double(),\n  ..   day = col_double(),\n  ..   year = col_double(),\n  ..   plot_id = col_double(),\n  ..   species_id = col_character(),\n  ..   sex = col_character(),\n  ..   hindfoot_length = col_double(),\n  ..   weight = col_double(),\n  ..   genus = col_character(),\n  ..   species = col_character(),\n  ..   taxa = col_character(),\n  ..   plot_type = col_character()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=<externalptr> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen we loaded the data into R, it got stored as an object of class tibble, which is a special kind of data frame (the difference is not important for our purposes, but you can learn more about tibbles here).\n\n\n\n\n\nInspecting dataframes\nThere are several functions that can be useful in checking content, structure, and other characteristics fo the dataframe.

This is contrast to some of the other columns that have a large range of possible number values.\nFactor – a special class for working with categorical data\n\nOnce created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set of values, know as levels\nStored as integers associated with labels\nCan be ordered or unordered\nAre treated as integer vectors\n\nWe can convert columns to the factor data type using the factor() function.\n\nsurveys$sex <- factor(surveys$sex)\n\nLet’s check the conversion with summary().\n\nsummary(surveys$sex)\n\n    F     M  NA's \n15690 17348  1748 \n\n\n\nBy default, R always sorts levels in alphabetical order. For instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels, like below.\n\nsex <- factor(c(\"male\", \"female\", \"female\", \"male\"))\n\nR will assign\n\n1 to the level \"female\"\n2 to the level \"male\"\n\nYou can see this by using the function levels().\n\nlevels(sex)\n\n[1] \"female\" \"male\"  \n\n\nYou can find the number of level using nlevels()\n\nnlevels(sex)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\nSometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you might want to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., “low”, “medium”, “high”), it improves your visualization, or it is required by a particular type of analysis.\nHere, one way to reorder our levels in the sex vector would be:\n\nsex # current order\n\n[1] male   female female male  \nLevels: female male\n\nsex <- factor(sex, levels = c(\"male\", \"female\"))\nsex # after re-ordering\n\n[1] male   female female male  \nLevels: male female\n\n\n\nWhile factors are represented by integers (1, 2, 3), they are more informative because they are self-describing: \"female\", \"male\" is more descriptive than 1, 2.\nFactors have this information built in, which is helpful when there are many levels (like the species names in our example dataset).\n\n\nChallenge\n\nQ&A: What code would you write to do the following?\n\nChange the columns taxa and genus in the surveys dataframe into a factor.\nUsing the functions you learned before, can you find out…\n\n\nHow many rabbits were observed?\nHow many different genera are in the genus column?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnum_char <- c(1, 2, 3, \"a\")\nsurveys$taxa <- factor(surveys$taxa)\nsurveys$genus <- factor(surveys$genus)\nsummary(surveys)\n\n   record_id         month             day            year         plot_id     \n Min.   :    1   Min.   : 1.000   Min.   : 1.0   Min.   :1977   Min.   : 1.00  \n 1st Qu.: 8964   1st Qu.: 4.000   1st Qu.: 9.0   1st Qu.:1984   1st Qu.: 5.00  \n Median :17762   Median : 6.000   Median :16.0   Median :1990   Median :11.00  \n Mean   :17804   Mean   : 6.474   Mean   :16.1   Mean   :1990   Mean   :11.34  \n 3rd Qu.:26655   3rd Qu.:10.000   3rd Qu.:23.0   3rd Qu.:1997   3rd Qu.:17.00  \n Max.   :35548   Max.   :12.000   Max.   :31.0   Max.   :2002   Max.   :24.00  \n                                                                               \n  species_id          sex        hindfoot_length     weight      \n Length:34786       F   :15690   Min.   : 2.00   Min.   :  4.00  \n Class :character   M   :17348   1st Qu.:21.00   1st Qu.: 20.00  \n Mode  :character   NA's: 1748   Median :32.00   Median : 37.00  \n                                 Mean   :29.29   Mean   : 42.67  \n                                 3rd Qu.:36.00   3rd Qu.: 48.00  \n                                 Max.   :70.00   Max.   :280.00  \n                                 NA's   :3348    NA's   :2503    \n             genus         species               taxa        plot_type        \n Dipodomys      :16167   Length:34786       Bird   :  450   Length:34786      \n Chaetodipus    : 6029   Class :character   Rabbit :   75   Class :character  \n Onychomys      : 3267   Mode  :character   Reptile:   14   Mode  :character  \n Reithrodontomys: 2694                      Rodent :34247                     \n Peromyscus     : 2234                                                        \n Perognathus    : 1629                                                        \n (Other)        : 2766                                                        \n\nnlevels(surveys$genus)\n\n[1] 26\n\n## * how many genera: There are 26 unique genera in the `genus` column.\n## * how many rabbts: There are 75 rabbits in the `taxa` column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting Factors\nTo convert a factor to a character vector, you can use the as.character() function.\n\nas.character(sex)\n\n[1] \"male\"   \"female\" \"female\" \"male\"  \n\n\n\nWhile factors are an efficient way to represent data (because each unique character value is represented once), there may be times when you want to convert factors to numeric vectors, for example, performing simple mathematical operations.\nFor this, you cannot use as.numeric(), since this will just return the index values of the factor, not the levels. To avoid this, we conver factors –> characters –> numbers.\nAnother method is to use the levels() function.\nHere’s an example.\n\nyear_fct <- factor(c(1990, 1983, 1977, 1998, 1990))\nas.numeric(year_fct)               # Wrong! And there is no warning...\n\n[1] 3 2 1 4 3\n\nas.numeric(as.character(year_fct)) # Works...\n\n[1] 1990 1983 1977 1998 1990\n\nas.numeric(levels(year_fct))[year_fct]    # The recommended way.\n\n[1] 1990 1983 1977 1998 1990\n\n\n\nLet’s break down the levels() approach.\nThere are 3 steps that occur:\n\nWe obtain all the factor levels using levels(year_fct)\nWe convert these levels to numeric values using as.numeric(levels(year_fct))\nWe access these numeric values using the underlying integers of the vector year_fct inside the square brackets.\n\n\n\n\nRenaming factors\nWhen your data are stored as factors, you can use the plot() function to get a quick glance at the number of observations represented by each factor level.\nLet’s look at the number of males and females captured over the course of the experiment.\n\n## bar plot of the number of females and males captured during the experiment\nplot(surveys$sex)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the plot above, we’re missing the individuals for which sex information was not recorded. To show them in the plot we can convert the missing values into a factor level with addNA(). We’ll need to also give the factor a label.\nNote: We are going to make a copy of the sex column so that we are not modigying the working copy of the dataframe.\n\nsex <- surveys$sex #create a copy\nlevels(sex) #look at the levels\n\n[1] \"F\" \"M\"\n\nsex <- addNA(sex) #addNA as a level\nlevels(sex) #check the levels again\n\n[1] \"F\" \"M\" NA \n\nhead(sex) #look at the data\n\n[1] M    M    <NA> <NA> <NA> <NA>\nLevels: F M <NA>\n\nlevels(sex)[3] <- \"undetermined\" #assign the value \"undetermined\" to the third, by index, level\nlevels(sex) #check the levels again\n\n[1] \"F\"            \"M\"            \"undetermined\"\n\nhead(sex) #look at the dataset again\n\n[1] M            M            undetermined undetermined undetermined\n[6] undetermined\nLevels: F M undetermined\n\n\nNow we can plot the data again, using plot(sex).\n\nplot(sex)\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\nQ&A: Write the code to do the following:\n\nRename “F” and “M” to “female” and “male” respectively.\nNow that we have renamed the factor level to “undetermined”, can you create the bar plot such that “undetermined” is first (before “female”)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here for the answer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlevels(sex)[1:2] <- c(\"female\", \"male\")\nsex <- factor(sex, levels = c(\"undetermined\", \"female\", \"male\"))\nplot(sex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ&A: We have seen how dataframes are created when using read_csv(), but they can also be created by hand with the data.frame() function.

If not, use it to your advantage to detect mistakes that might have been introduced during data entry (for instance, a letter in a column that should only contain numbers).\n\n\n\nFormatting dates\nA common challenge for R users is converting date and time information into an analysis-suitable format.\nOne way to start date information is to store each component (day, month, year) in a separate column. We can see thatsurveys takes this approach.\n\nstr(surveys)\n\nspc_tbl_ [34,786 × 13] (S3: spec_tbl_df/tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ record_id      : num [1:34786] 1 72 224 266 349 363 435 506 588 661 ...\n $ month          : num [1:34786] 7 8 9 10 11 11 12 1 2 3 ...\n $ day            : num [1:34786] 16 19 13 16 12 12 10 8 18 11 ...\n $ year           : num [1:34786] 1977 1977 1977 1977 1977 ...\n $ plot_id        : num [1:34786] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ species_id     : chr [1:34786] \"NL\" \"NL\" \"NL\" \"NL\" ...\n $ sex            : Factor w/ 2 levels \"F\",\"M\": 2 2 NA NA NA NA NA NA 2 NA ...\n $ hindfoot_length: num [1:34786] 32 31 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ weight         : num [1:34786] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 218 NA ...\n $ genus          : Factor w/ 26 levels \"Ammodramus\",\"Ammospermophilus\",..: 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 ...\n $ species        : chr [1:34786] \"albigula\" \"albigula\" \"albigula\" \"albigula\" ...\n $ taxa           : Factor w/ 4 levels \"Bird\",\"Rabbit\",..: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 ...\n $ plot_type      : chr [1:34786] \"Control\" \"Control\" \"Control\" \"Control\" ...\n - attr(*, \"spec\")=\n  .. cols(\n  ..   record_id = col_double(),\n  ..   month = col_double(),\n  ..   day = col_double(),\n  ..   year = col_double(),\n  ..   plot_id = col_double(),\n  ..   species_id = col_character(),\n  ..   sex = col_character(),\n  ..   hindfoot_length = col_double(),\n  ..   weight = col_double(),\n  ..   genus = col_character(),\n  ..   species = col_character(),\n  ..   taxa = col_character(),\n  ..   plot_type = col_character()\n  .. )\n - attr(*, \"problems\")=<externalptr> \n\n\nWe’ll use the ymd() function from the lubridate packages (installed with tidyverse).\nLoad the package.\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\nLoading required package: timechange\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'lubridate'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    date, intersect, setdiff, union\n\n\n\nLet’s create a data object and inspect the structure.\n\nmy_date <- ymd(\"2015-01-01\")\nstr(my_date)\n\n Date[1:1], format: \"2015-01-01\"\n\n\n\nNow let’s paste the year, month, and day separately - we get the same result.\n\n# sep indicates the character to use to separate each component\nmy_date <- ymd(paste(\"2015\", \"1\", \"1\", sep = \"-\")) \nstr(my_date)\n\n Date[1:1], format: \"2015-01-01\"\n\n\n\nNow we apply this function to the surveys dataset.

We will also use head() so we don’t clutter the output.\n\nmissing_dates <- surveys[is.na(surveys$date), c(\"year\", \"month\", \"day\")]\n\nhead(missing_dates)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n   year month   day\n  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1  2000     9    31\n2  2000     4    31\n3  2000     4    31\n4  2000     4    31\n5  2000     4    31\n6  2000     9    31\n\n\nLooking at the dates that were not converted, it seems that they don’t actualy exist – September and April only have 30 days, not 31 days as it is specified in our dataset.\nThere are several ways you could deal with situation:\n\nIf you have access to the raw data (e.g., field sheets) or supporting information (e.g., field trip reports/logs), check them and ensure the electronic database matches the information in the original data source.\nIf you are able to contact the person responsible for collecting the data, you could refer to them and ask for clarification.\nYou could also check the rest of the dataset for clues about the correct value for the erroneous dates.\nIf your project has guidelines on how to correct this sort of errors, refer to them and apply any recommendations.\nIf it is not possible to ascertain the correct value for these observations, you may want to leave them as missing data.\n\nRegardless of the option you choose, it is important that you document the error and the corrections (if any) that you apply to your data.\n\n\n\nCitations\n\nData Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists. https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html"
