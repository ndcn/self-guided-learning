### What is R? What is R Studio?

- `R` is a (mostly statistical) programming language and a software that interprets scripts written in `R`
- `RStudio` is an interface used to interact with `R`

---

### Why learn R?

**Increased reproducibility**  
When using code, your analysis can be clearly understood and easily rerun.

**Increased extensibility**   
Combine `R` with 10,000+ packages to extend capabilities including image analysis, time-series, population genetics, additional languages, making websites, and more.

**Works with a variety of data types, shapes, and sizes**  
`R` has special data structures and data types to handle all sorts of data.  
`R` can also connect to spreadsheets, databases, and read in special data formats.

**Can produce publication-quality graphics**
Base functionality and packages allow you to create a variety of graphics, while controlling minute details.

**Has a large and welcoming community**  
The `R` user-community is VERY active, helpful, and welcoming.  
Many resources have been developed to help people learn how to use R.

### Knowing your around RStudio

`RStudio` is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for working with `R` and can be use to do many things. We will cover things in ***bold and italics***.

- ***write code and scripts***
- ***run code***
- ***navigate files on your computer***
- ***inspect variables and data objects***
- ***visualize plots***
- enable version control
- develop packages
- write `Shiny` apps


::: {#fig-rstudio}

![](/images/rstudio-screenshot.png)

`RStudio` interface screenshot. Clockwise from top left: Source,Environment/History, Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer,Console. [1]
:::

`RStudio` is divided into 4 "panes":

- The **Source** for your scripts and documents (top-left, in the default layout)
- Your **Environment/History** (top-right) which shows all the objects in your working space (Environment) and your command history (History)
- Your **Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer** (bottom-right)
- The `R` **Console** (bottom-left)

---

### Getting Set Up

We want to keep our work (data, analyses, text) self-contained in a single directory, called the **working directory**. This allows us to use **relative paths** to other files in our scripts within that working directory so that we can move our project to other locations and share our project with others without breaking any scripts.

We can do this using "Projects" in `RStudio`.

1. Start `RStudio`.
2. Under the `File` menu, click on `New Project`. Choose `New Directory`, then `New Project`.
3. Enter a name for this new folder (or "directory"), and choose a convenient location for it. This will be your **working directory** for the rest of the day (e.g., `~/data-carpentry`).
4. Click on `Create Project`.
5. Download the [code handout](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/code-handout.R), place it in your working directory and rename it (e.g.,`data-carpentry-script.R`).
6. (Optional) Set Preferences to 'Never' save workspace in `RStudio`.

::: {.callout-tip}
**Workspaces**

A workspace is your working environment in `R` and includes any user-defined object.

By default, all objects in a workspace are saved (to `.RData`) and reloaded when you open your project. While this can be useful, this can result in debugging issues by having objects in memory that you forgot about. Therefore, we recommended to turn this off by

1. Go to `Tools` > `Global Options`.
2. Select 'Never' option for  'Save workspace to .RData on exit.'

::: {#fig-rstudio}

![](/images/rstudio-preferences.png)

Set 'Save workspace to .RData on exit' to'Never'. [1]
:::

---

### The Working Directory

The working directory is the place from there `R` (and your computer) will be looking for and saving files and directories.

It's good practice to develop a common structure for your projects to:

- keep things organized
- ensure you and others can find things in various projects
- increase the portability of scripts that might be useful in multiple projects


| Directory  | Contains |
|------------|----------|
| `scripts/` | `R` scripts for analyses, plotting, etc. |
| `data/`     | Raw data and processed data (probably should be kept separately) | 
| `documents/` | Outlines, drafts, other texts | 

**Creating our directory structure**

For our purposes, we'll create the following structure

::: {#fig-setup-directory}

![](/images/r-starting-how-it-should-look-like.png)

How it should look like at the beginning of this lesson [1]
:::

That means a working directory called `data-carpentry`, then 3 subdirectories, `data_raw`, `data`, and `fig`.

Let's do this programmatically in the `Console`.

1. Use `R` command called `dir.create`, passing the value "~/data_carpentry" as the "path".

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
dir.create("~/data-carpentry")
```

2. Create the subdirectories.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
dir.create("~/data-carpentry/data_raw")
dir.create("~/data-carpentry/data")
dir.create("~/data-carpentry/fig")
```

::: {.callout-tip}

The tilde `~` is a special character that means the home directory of the user.

:::

---

### Interacting with R

In order to do anything in `R` we need to tell the computer what to do. We do this with a **command**. An example is the `dir.create` command that you used to create the directory structure just now. We can do this in 2 ways

- using the console (as you did above) 
- using the script pane above

What's the benefit of using the script?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
### _Click here for the answer_  

Reproducibility. Commands types in the console will eventually disappear. Using a script allows you to keep a record of what was done.

:::

`RStudio` allows you to execute commands directly from the script editor.

| OS | Shortcut |
|----|----------|
| Windows | <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd> |
| macOS | <kbd>`Ctrl`</kbd> + <kbd>`Enter`</kbd> OR <kbd>`Cmd`</kbd> + <kbd>`Return`</kbd> |

You can find other keyboard shortcuts in this [RStudio cheatsheet about the RStudioIDE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rstudio-ide.pdf).

### Seeking help

If you need help with a specific function, for instance `mean()`, you can type `?mean()` and press enter. Documentation on the function will pop up in the **Help** window.

::: {#fig-help}

![](/images/rstudiohelp.png)

`RStudio` help panel. When typing a word in the search field, it will show related suggestions. [1]
:::

---

### Automatic Code Completion

When you write code in `RStudio`, you can use its automatic code completion to remind yourself of a function's name or arguments. 

1. Start typing the function name and pay attention to the suggestions that pop up. 
2. Use the up and down arrow to select a suggested code completion and <kbd>Tab</kbd> to apply it. 

::: {.callout-tip}

You can also use code completion to complete function's argument names, object, names and file names. It even works if you don't get the spelling 100% correct.

:::

---

### Dealing with error messages

We WILL encounter errors, and a lot of them! Watch for red "X"'s next to the line number in `RStudio` to catch them.

::: {#fig-error}

![](/images/rstudioredx.png)

`RStudio` shows a red x next to a line of code that `R` doesn't understand. [1]
:::

If you need more help

- Google the error
- Ask a question (with appropriate context and an example) on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r?tab=Votes)

---

### Creating objects in R
You can get output from `R` simply by typing math in the console:


```{r}
#| eval: true
3 + 5
12 / 7
```

---

This can be more useful if we store these ***values*** as ***objects***, which would allow us to refer back to these objects later.We do this by using the assignment operator `<-`. 

For example, if we wanted to create an object named `weight_kg` and assign it the value of `55`, we could type the following

```{r}
#| eval: false
weight_kg <- 55
```

---

:::{.callout-note}
**A note on naming**

Objects can be named _just about_ anything (`x`, `the_thing`, `other_5tUfF`). Be thoughtful about what you use. Below are some guidelines

- Be explicit and not too long.
- They cannot start with a number (`2x` is not valid, but `x2` is).
- R is case sensitive, so for example, `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`.
- There are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in `R` (e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, see [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html) for a complete list). If in doubt, double-check
- Avoid dots (`.`) within names. Dots have a special meaning (methods) in `R` and other programming languages. To avoid confusion, don't include dots in names.
- Use nouns for object names and verbs for function names.
- Be consistent in the styling of your code, such as where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc.
:::

---

When assigning a value to an object, `R` does not print anything. You can force `R` to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the object name:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
weight_kg <- 55    # doesn't print anything
(weight_kg <- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`
weight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object
```

---

Now that `R` has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. Let's convert this weight into pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
2.2 * weight_kg
```

---

We can also change an object's value by assigning it a new one:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

---

Assigning a value to one object does not change the values of other objects. 

For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a new object, `weight_lb`:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
```

Now, let's change `weight_kg` to 100.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
weight_kg <- 100
```

What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`? 126.5 or 220?

---

### Saving your code

Until now, we've used the console. Since we want to save our work, let's

1. Open up a script -- by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>.
2. Save the script -- by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> and selecting the save location, and naming it.

---

### Adding Comments

In `R` the comment character is `#`. Anything to the right of `#` in a script will be ignored by `R`. We use comments to leave notes and explanations in scripts.

---

age  <- age - 20        # age?

age  <- age - 20        # age is 102
mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index is 0.9313725
```

### Functions and their arguments

Functions are "canned scripts" that automate more complicated sets of commands including operations assignments, etc. 

- Usually takes one or more inputs called *arguments*
- Often return a *value* (but not always)
- Example: `sqrt()` takes a number as the argument and returns the square root of the number

::: {.callout-note}
Many functions are predefined, or can be made available by importing `R` *packages* (more on that later). 
:::

---

Executing a function ('running it') is called *calling* the function. An example of a function call is:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
weight_kg <- sqrt(10)
```

Let's break it down

- the value of 10 is given to the `sqrt()` function
- the `sqrt()` function calculates the square root
- the function returns the value which is then assigned to the object `weight_kg`

---

**Return values**

As noted earlier, a value is not always returned. If returned, the return 'value'

- can be any value, or thing
- can be multiple values (a set of things)
- can even be a dataset

**Arguments**

Arguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other objects. 

- Each argument can differ based on the function, and must be looked up in the documentation (see below). 
- Some functions take multiple arguments
- Some arguments MUST be specified by the user when calling the function
- Some arugments might take on a *default* value (these are called *options*) if left out


:::{.callout-tip}
Options are typically used to alter the way the function operates, such as whether it ignores 'bad values', or what symbol to use in a plot.  However, if you want something specific, you can specify a value of your choice which will be used instead of the default.
:::

---

Let's try a function that can take multiple arguments: `round()`.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
round(3.14159)
```

We called `round()` with just one argument, `3.14159`, and it returned the value `3`. That's because the default is to round to the nearest whole number. 

---

Let's modify the number of digits we want in the answer. How do we know how to find more information about the `round` function?

We can use `args(round)` to find what arguments it takes.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
args(round)
```

We can also look at the help for this function using `?round`.

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
?round
```


We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can type `digits = 2` or however many we want. Let's try it.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
```

---

If you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you don't have to name them:

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
round(3.14159, 2)
```

And if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)
```

:::{.callout-tip}
It's good practice to put the non-optional arguments (like the number you're rounding) first in your function call, and to then specify the names of all optional arguments.  If you don't, someone reading your code might have to look up the definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you're doing.
:::

### Vectors and data types

A vector is the most common and basic data type in `R`. 

- Can be a series of values (numbers or characters).
- Assigned using `c()` function

For example, let's create a vector of animal weights and assign it to an object `weight_g`:
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g
```

---

A vector can also contain characters:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
animals
```

The quotes around "mouse", "rat", etc. are essential here. Without the quotes `R` will assume objects have been created called `mouse`, `rat` and `dog`. As these objects don't exist in `R`'s memory, there will be an error message.

---

There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a vector. `length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
length(weight_g)
length(animals)
```

---

All of the elements are the same type of data. The function `class()` indicates what kind of object you are working with:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
class(weight_g)
class(animals)
```

---

The function `str()` provides an overview of the structure of an object and its elements. It is a useful function when working with large and complex objects:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
str(weight_g)
str(animals)
```

---

You can use the `c()` function to add other elements to your vector:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector
weight_g <- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector
weight_g
```

Let's break this down:

1. In the first line, we take the original vector `weight_g`, add the value `90` to the end of it, and save the result back into `weight_g`. 
2. Then we add the value `30` to the beginning, again saving the result back into `weight_g`.

We can do this over and over again to grow a vector, or assemble a dataset. As we program, this may be useful to add results that we are collecting or calculating.

---

An **atomic vector** is the simplest `R` **data type** and is a linear vector of a single type. These are the basic building blocks that all `R` objects are built from. 

The there are 6 main **atomic vector** thar `R` uses:

- `"character"` for character (`A`) or string values (`Apple`)
- `"numeric"` (or `"double"`) for all real numbers with our without decimal values
- `"logical"` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` (the boolean data type)
- `"integer"` for integer numbers (e.g., `2L`, the `L` suffix indicates to `R` that it's an integer)
- `"complex"` to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g.,`1 + 4i`) and that's all we're going to say about them
- `"raw"` for bitstreams that we won't discuss further

You can check the type of your vector using the `typeof()` function and inputting your vector as the argument.

---

Vectors are one of the many **data structures** that `R` uses. Other important ones are lists (`list`), matrices (`matrix`), data frames (`data.frame`), factors (`factor`) and arrays (`array`).

:::

:::

:::{.panel-input}

_**Q&A**_: Why do you think it happens?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
### _Click here for the answer_  
  
Vectors can be of only one data type. `R` tries to convert (coerce) the content of this vector to find a "common denominator" that doesn't lose any information.

:::

:::

:::{.panel-input}

_**Q&A**_: How many values in `combined_logical` are `"TRUE"` (as a character) in the following example (reusing the 2 `..._logical`s from above):

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
### _Click here for the answer_  
  
Only one. There is no memory of past data types, and the coercion happens the first time the vector is evaluated. Therefore, the `TRUE` in `num_logical` gets converted into a `1` before it gets converted into `"1"` in `combined_logical`.

:::

:::

:::{.panel-input}

_**Q&A**_: You've probably noticed that objects of different types get converted into a single, shared type within a vector. In `R`, we call converting objects from one class into another class *coercion*. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy, whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other types. Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how these data types are coerced?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
### _Click here for the answer_  

```
logical → numeric → character ← logical
```
:::

:::

---

### Subsetting vectors

If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must provide one or several indices (positions of elements in the object, starting with 1) in square brackets. 

For instance:
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
animals[c(3, 2)]
```

---

We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements than the original one:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
more_animals <- animals[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
more_animals
```

---

`R` indices start at 1. Programming languages like `Fortran`, `MATLAB`, `Julia`, and `R` start counting at 1, because that's what human beings typically do. Languages in the `C` family (including `C++`, `Java`, `Perl`, and `Python`) count from 0 because that's simpler for computers to do.

---

**Conditional subsetting**

Another common way of subsetting is by using a logical vector. 

- `TRUE` will select the element with the same index 
- `FALSE` will not select the element with the same index

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

---

Some functions and logical tests will output vectors of logical values, which can be useful.

For exmaple, if you wanted to select only the values above 50:

```{r, results="show", purl=FALSE}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
weight_g > 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition

## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g > 50]
```

Let's break it down.
1. The `weight_g > 50` inside the brackets is evaluated and returns a list of `TRUE` for indices less than 50
2. The outside `weight_g` is subsetted based on that returned list, pulling out only the indices that are `TRUE`

---

You can combine multiple tests using `&` (both conditions are true, AND) or `|` (at least one of the conditions is true, OR):

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
weight_g[weight_g > 30 & weight_g < 50]
weight_g[weight_g <= 30 | weight_g == 55]
weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21]
```

A quick overview of some operators

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `&` | and |
| `|` | or |
| `>` | greater than |
| `<` | less than |
| `>=` | greater than or equal to |
| `<=` | less than or equal to | 
| `==` | is equal to |

---

The function `%in%` allows you to test if any of the elements of a search vector are found:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat", "cat")

# return both rat and cat
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"]

# return a logical vector that is TRUE for the elements within animals
# that are found in the character vector and FALSE for those that are not
animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat", "bird", "fish")

# use the logical vector created by %in% to return elements from animals
# that are found in the character vector
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck", "goat", "bird", "fish")]
```

---

#### Challenge

:::{.panel-input}

_**Q&A**_: Can you figure out why `"four" > "five"` returns `TRUE`?

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
### _Click here for the answer_  

When using ">" or "<" on strings, `R` compares their alphabetical order. Here "four" comes after "five", and therefore is "greater than" it.
:::

:::

---

### Missing data

Missing data are represented in vectors as `NA`. When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if the data you are working with include missing values. 

For example, the `mean()` below:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
```

---

This feature makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with missing data. You can add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to calculate the result as if the missing values were removed (`rm` stands for ReMoved) first.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar with the functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()`. See below for examples.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]

## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed.
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
na.omit(heights)

## Extract those elements which are complete cases.
#The returned object is an atomic vector of type `"numeric"` (or #`"double"`).
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
```

Recall that you can use the `typeof()` function to find the type of your atomic vector.

#### Challenge

:::{.panel-input}

_**Q&A**_: 1. Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector, `heights_no_na`, with the NAs removed.

  ```

2. Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.

3. Use `R` to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.?

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)

# 1.
heights_no_na <- heights[!is.na(heights)]
# or
heights_no_na <- na.omit(heights)
# or
heights_no_na <- heights[complete.cases(heights)]

# 2.
median(heights, na.rm = TRUE)

# 3.
heights_above_67 <- heights_no_na[heights_no_na > 67]
length(heights_above_67)
```
