### What is the shell?

The `shell` (also known as the `command-line`) is a program that allows us to tell the computer what to do by giving it a "command" _**Figure 1a**_.

::: {.callout-tip}
Other names for the `shell` are `terminal`, `Bash`, `UNIX command line`, and more.
:::

Another common way we tell the computer what to do is through the use of a "point and click" graphical user interface (GUI) approach _**Figure 1b**_.

### Why use the shell?

Isn't pointing and clicking easier? Imagine you had the following task:

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
You have a directory with 10 `.txt` files.

Pull the first line from each file into a single new file. You should end up with a list of all of the first lines.
:::

Take a look below to see the process for GUI and CLI.

:::{.panel-tabset}
## GUI Steps
```
1. Create new file
2. Open file 1, copy line 1, paste into new file, close file 1.
3. Open file 2, copy line 1, paste into new file, close file 2.
4. Repeat 7 more times
```

## CLI Code
```
head -n1 -q *.txt > new-file.txt
```
:::

For this task, the GUI was tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone while the CLI was a single-command, quick, and _relatively error proof_.

### Accessing the Shell

Let's start using the `shell`. Open the `shell` (`terminal`) on your computer. Select the appropriate instructions below, based on your operating system.

:::{.panel-tabset}
## Windows Instructions

1. Go the the Start menu and select "All Apps".
2. Scroll down the list of applications and select the `Git` option.
3. From the drop-down menu, select `Git Bash`. 
4. A terminal should open up.

## macOS Instructions

1. Open Finder and go to the Applications tab.
2. Scroll down the list of applications and select `Utilities`.
3. Select `Terminal`.
4. A terminal should open up.

### Using the shell

Once we open our terminal, the `$` shows us that `shell` is ready for input.

Let's see what day it is using the `cal` command.

- `cal` stands for calendar
- prints out the calendar to the terminal

In your terminal, type `cal` and press enter.

```{bash}
#| eval: true
#| output: true
cal
```

Before we learn more commands, let's learn about the structure of commands.

---

### Command syntax

Commands follow a general syntax  
`command` `option/flag` `argument`

- `command` -- the main command
- `option/flag` -- modifies the behavior of the command, often optional
- `argument` -- the source and/or target of the command, sometimes optional

::: {.callout-tip}
- Options use either `-` or `--` to signal their usage.
- Arguments can be either a target (as in the `ls` command) or both a source and target (as in the `mv` command)
:::

#### Alter Command Behavior

Let's change the way `cal` command behaves by providing a value for the `option`.

In your terminal, type `cal -j` and press enter. 

```{bash}
cal -j
```

This `-j` option/flag returns the calendar using the "Julian" date, which is a numbered day starting at January 1.

### Getting help

To better understand command usage and their options we can use the following (depending on the command).

| Method of getting help | Description | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `--help` or `-h` option/flag |  Displays help menu for the command/program | `cal --help` |
| `man` command | Displays the manual for the command/program in-depth | `man cal` |

### Making sense of errors

The shell provides (usually) helpful and informative error messages. 

For example, if you look closely at the `cal --help` example above, you'll see that the usage of `--help` actually resulted in an error (see below).

```
cal: illegal option -- -
Usage: cal [general options] [-hjy] [[month] year]
       cal [general options] [-hj] [-m month] [year]
       ncal [general options] [-hJjpwy] [-s country_code] [[month] year]
       ncal [general options] [-hJeo] [year]
General options: [-NC3] [-A months] [-B months]
For debug the highlighting: [-H yyyy-mm-dd] [-d yyyy-mm]
```

:::{.panel-input}

_**Q&A**_: What is the error above telling us?
