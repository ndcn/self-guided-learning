### Goals and Topics

This training series is intended for absolute beginners and focused on the basic usage of the Bash Shell. Concepts introduced in these sessions are foundational to the application of computational approaches and will enable more powerful and reproducible research.

By the end of the series, you should be able to

- describe the Unix file system structure
- navigate the Unix file system from the command line
- create, view, and manipulate files and directories
- chain bash shell commands together
- create a basic Bash shell script to automate tasks
