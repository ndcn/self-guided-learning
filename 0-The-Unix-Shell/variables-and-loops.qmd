### Storing and Using Values -- Variables

Values can be temporarily stored into items called `variables`. This is very useful in looping and scripting, particularly when we may not know or be able to keep track of values.

Interestingly, we use diffent syntax when assigning/unsetting and using variables.

- ***setting variables*** -- use `variable=value` 
- ***using variables*** -- use `$variable`
- ***unsetting variables*** -- use `unset variable`

  ```{bash}
  #| eval: true

  #create a variable named file_type and assign it a value of fastq
  file_type="fastq"

  #call the file_type variable, print it to the screen
  echo "the value after setting:" $file_type

  #unset (or remove) the variable assignment
  unset file_type
  
  #check for the value of file_type
  echo "the value after unsetting:" $file_type 
  ```

# Tips and Tricks with Variables

- When setting, no spaces around the `=` -- `variable = value` will not do what we want.
- Using quotes when calling variables prevents weird issues -- `command "$variable"` prevents issues when variable values have spaces, etc.
- Command output can be stored using `$()` -- `variable=$(command x)` stores the output of `command x` as `variable`.
- Suffixes can be added by using `${variable}` -- `"${file_type}1"` from above would be `fastq1`

#### Variables -- Checking Understanding

:::{.panel-input}

_**Q&A**_: Which of the following correctly assigns the value of `fastq` to a variable named `file_suffix`?

a. `fastq=$file_suffix`
b. `fastq = $file_suffix`
c. `fastq=file_suffix`
d. `file_suffix=fastq`
e. `file_suffix=$fastq`

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
### _Click here for the answer_  

a. `fastq=$file_suffix` -- No. Refers to a variable that doesn't exist and wrong order.
b. `fastq = $file_suffix` -- No. The added space tries to call a command named fastq. Also, this is the wrong order.
c. `fastq=file_suffix` -- No. This is the wrong order and would create a variable called fastq.
d. `file_suffix=fastq` -- Yes.
e. `file_suffix=$fastq` -- No. Refers to a variable that doesn't exist.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
### _Click here for the answer_  

`sampleXext1`

The value of `name1` begins with `$base1`, which is correctly referenced and holds the value of `"sampleX"`. This is followed by `$"ext1"`. There is no variable named `"ext1"`, the variable is actually named `ext1`, which would be referenced by `$ext1`, or `${ext1}`, or `"$ext1"`, or `"${ext1}"`. By having `$` before the quotes, we're really just adding in a string value at the end.

#### Use Case

Let's see how we can use variables, combined with previous commands/methods in a quick analysis. 

From the `example.gtf` file ([downloaded and used in the previous lesson](./patterns-filters-and-pipes.qmd#download-the-gtf)), which chromosome has the highest number of genes? What about exons?

A reminder, the initial structure is below, with the chromosome name in the first field, and the feature type in the third field.
```{bash}
#| eval: true 

# cd to ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data

# view first few lines of the file
head example.gtf
```

From last time, we remember that we need to remove the leading lines of the file to make it easier to work with, using `grep -v '^#'`, then we can `cut` the fields that we need, sort and count the total genes with `sort | uniq -c | grep 'gene'`. This gives us the following output.

```{bash}
#| eval: true 
# cd to directory
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data

# print the file to the screen to pipe it into grep
# remove the lines with #! because they'll get in the way
# cut to keep the first and third columns (chromosome, biotype)
# sort values
# keep unique values, specifying counts of each unique value to get totals of biotypes by chromosome
# pull out gene biotype totals
cat example.gtf | grep -v '^#' | cut -f1,3 | sort | uniq -c | grep 'gene'
```

We're not quite there yet. Let's capture the output as a variable, named `chr_n`, to use for later. 

_Note: We're introducing `awk` here, a language the is quite useful in parsing text, to print out the second column `$2`._

```{bash}
#| eval: true 
# cd to directory
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data

# print the file to the screen to pipe it into grep
# remove the lines with #! because they'll get in the way
# cut to keep the first and third columns (chromosome, biotype)
# sort values
# keep unique values, specifying counts of each unique value to get totals of biotypes by chromosome
# pull out gene biotype totals
# grab the first line
# use awk to print the 2nd column
biotype_gene="gene"
biotype_exon="exon"
chr_n_gene=$(cat example.gtf | grep -v '^#' | cut -f1,3 | sort | uniq -c | grep $biotype_gene | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2;}')
chr_n_exon=$(cat example.gtf | grep -v '^#' | cut -f1,3 | sort | uniq -c | grep $biotype_exon | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2;}')

echo "The chromosome with the most "$biotype_gene" is: "$chr_n_gene
echo "The chromosome with the most "$biotype_exon" is: "$chr_n_exon
```

The option to capture values and use them in further commands is really evident when we get into loops.

### Performing Actions, Repetitively

Loops allow us to perform a command (or set of commands) on each item in a list.

#### For Loop Syntax

Bash for loops follow a specific syntax.

:::{#fig-bash-syntax}
![](/images/loops.jpg)

The syntax of a bash for loop.
:::

Key components of the syntax

- keywords `for`, `in`, `do`, `done` -- tell bash when portions of the loop are coming
- `item` -- a variable that holds the value of an item from the list for an iteration of the loop
- `list` -- a set of items (list or array) to iterate over
- `commands` -- the command(s) performed with each item in the list or array


---

Let's work through an example from our sample data in `~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures`, by printing out the first two lines of each file.

Walking through the 4 lines, line-by-line.

:::{.panel-tabset}

# First line

1. The keyword `for` tells the computer we are entering a loop.
2. A variable named `filename` is created, which is initially empty.
3. The keyword `in` tells the computer to create an empty list.
4. `basilisk.dat`, `minotour.dat`, and `unicorn.dat` are added to the list.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| class-source: "numberLines"
#| source-line-numbers: "4"
#cd to ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures

for filename in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
do
  head -n 2 $filename
done
```

# Second line

5. The keyword `do` tells the computer to listen for the following commands perform on each item in the list.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| class-source: "numberLines"
#| source-line-numbers: "5"
#cd to ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures

for filename in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
do
  head -n 2 $filename
done
```


# Third line

6. The computer the commands to perform on the value held by the variable `$filename`.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| class-source: "numberLines"
#| source-line-numbers: "6"
#cd to ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures

for filename in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
do
  head -n 2 $filename
done
```

# Fourth line

7. The keyword `done` tells the computer that the loop is over.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| class-source: "numberLines"
#| source-line-numbers: "7"
#cd to ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures

for filename in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat
do
  head -n 2 $filename
done
```


:::

In the example above, there are 3 iterations of the loop. Notice how the value of `filename` changes with each iteration.

+-----------+----------------+-----------------------------------------+
| Iteration | `filename`     | list                                    |
+:=========:+================+=========================================+
| 1         | `basilisk.dat` | `basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat` |
+-----------+----------------+-----------------------------------------+
| 2         | `minotaur.dat` | `basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat` |
+-----------+----------------+-----------------------------------------+
| 3         | `unicorn.dat`  | `basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat` |
+-----------+----------------+-----------------------------------------+

:::{.callout-note}

The variable could be named anything -- in the example above, we can say

`for x in basilisk.dat minotaur.dat unicorn.dat` instead.

#### While Loop Syntax

A while loop is another useful type of loop in bash and follows a specific syntax.

:::{#fig-bash-syntax}
![](/images/while-loops.jpg)

The syntax of a bash while loop.
:::

Key components of the syntax

- keywords `while`, `do`, `done` -- tell bash when portions of the loop are coming
- `condition` -- a condition to be met for the loop to continue ("while true")
- `commands` -- the command(s) performed with each item in the list or array

Let's see an example where we print out numbers less than or equal to 7 (`-le`). 

_Note: We can increment `num` by 1 each time by reassigning the value of `num`, `num=$(($num+1))`._


```{bash}
#| eval: true 
num=1

while [ $num -le 7 ]
do
  echo $num" is less than or equal to 7."
  num=$(($num+1))
done
```

---

#### Using Variables in Loops

Let's return to our earlier example with the gtf file. Using a loop, we can now identify the chromosomes with the most of several biotypes.

```{bash}
#| eval: true 
# cd to directory
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data

for bt in gene exon transcript CDS start_codon
do 
 chr_n=$(cat example.gtf | grep -v '^#' | cut -f1,3 | sort | uniq -c | grep $bt | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2;}')
 echo "The chromosome with the most "$bt" is: "$chr_n
done
```

We can take this futher and capture all of the types of biotypes as an array to pass to the loop as a variable.

_Note: An item at position `x` in an array can be accessed via `array[x]`. In a loop, we use `${array[@]}` to access the item._

```{bash}
#| eval: true 
# cd to directory
cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data

# capture the types of biotypes as an array
btype_array=$(cat example.gtf | grep -v '^#' | cut -f3 | sort | uniq)

for bt in ${btype_array[@]}
do 
 chr_n=$(cat example.gtf | grep -v '^#' | cut -f1,3 | sort | uniq -c | grep $bt | head -n 1 | awk '{print $2;}')
 echo "The chromosome with the most "$bt" is: "$chr_n
done
```
